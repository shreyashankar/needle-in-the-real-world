    "transcript": "[doctor] Good morning, Mohammed. How have you been feeling since the last time we saw each other?\n[patient] Hello, Doctor. Honestly, I've been better. I've been experiencing more discomfort than usual.\n[doctor] I'm sorry to hear that. Tell me more about the discomfort you've been experiencing.\n[patient] Well, the pain in my joints, especially in my hands and knees, has increased. It's been harder to manage, even with the Adalimumab.\n[doctor] I see. How often are you taking the Adalimumab?\n[patient] I've been on the bi-weekly dosage, as prescribed. Taking it every other Friday.\n[doctor] All right, Mohammed. And are you still on the 40 mg pre-filled syringe?\n[patient] Yes, that's the one. I haven't missed a dose yet.\n[doctor] Good, sticking to the medication schedule is essential. Have there been any changes to your routine or lifestyle that might be contributing to this increase in pain?\n[patient] Not that I can think of. My routine has been pretty consistent. If anything, I've been trying to be more active to help with the joint stiffness.\n[doctor] Being active is generally good, but we have to ensure it's not exacerbating your condition. Are you warming up before exercising and cooling down afterward?\n[patient] Yes, I do a light warm-up and stretching. I try not to strain myself too much.\n[doctor] That's good to hear. How about your diet? Any changes there?\n[patient] I've been trying to eat healthier\u2014more greens, less processed food, and sugar. Trying to follow an anti-inflammatory diet.\n[doctor] Excellent choice, Mohammed. Diet can play a significant role in managing symptoms. Now, regarding the Adalimumab, have you noticed any side effects since you started it?\n[patient] Nothing significant. Sometimes I feel a bit fatigued after the injection, but that's about it.\n[doctor] Fatigue can be common. It's important to monitor any new symptoms, as they could indicate an issue. Let's take a closer look at your joints. Can you show me where exactly you're experiencing the most pain?\n[patient] Sure, it's mainly here in the knuckles and wrists, and my knees have been quite sore, especially when I climb stairs.\n[doctor] I understand. I'm going to examine your joints now. [doctor conducts a physical examination] There is some swelling and tenderness. Have you continued with the hot and cold treatments we talked about?\n[patient] Yes, I've been using an ice pack and sometimes a heated blanket. They seem to help a little.\n[doctor] Good, alternating between hot and cold can help manage the inflammation. Now, considering the increased pain, we might need to adjust your treatment plan. Have you been taking any other medications or supplements?\n[patient] Just the occasional ibuprofen when it gets really bad, and I take a multivitamin in the morning.\n[doctor] It's important to use NSAIDs like ibuprofen sparingly, as they can cause issues with long-term use. We'll discuss alternatives today. But before we proceed, can you tell me how your mood has been? Any changes in your sleep patterns or energy levels?\n[patient] My sleep's been okay, but with the pain, I sometimes wake up in the middle of the night. My energy levels are lower on those days.\n[doctor] Disrupted sleep can certainly affect your energy. Let's focus on improving your pain management, which should help with your sleep as well. Now, I'd like to order some tests to see if there's been any progression or changes we need to be aware of. We'll do some blood work and possibly an X-ray of the affected joints. How does that sound?\n[patient] Sounds good, Doctor. I just want some relief from this pain and to be able to do my daily activities without so much discomfort.\n[doctor] Of course, Mohammed. We'll work on that. After the tests, we can discuss whether we need to adjust your Adalimumab dosage or consider additional medications. There are options such as NSAID creams or even corticosteroid injections that can be localized to the affected joints.\n[patient] I appreciate that, Doctor. I'm willing to try whatever you think will help.\n[doctor] We'll make sure to find the right balance for you. In the meantime, I'm also going to refer you to a physical therapist. They can help with exercises specifically tailored to your condition, which can improve your joint function and reduce pain.\n[patient] That sounds helpful. I've never tried physical therapy before.\n[doctor] Many patients find it beneficial. It's about strengthening the muscles around the joints to provide better support. Now, I'm going to write down everything we've discussed and send the orders for your tests. Do you have any questions or concerns about what we've talked about so far?\n[patient] Not right now. You've been very thorough, Doctor.\n[doctor] Great. Remember, Mohammed, managing a condition like yours is a partnership between us. You're doing a great job, and we're here to support you every step of the way.\n[patient] Thank you for your help. It means a lot to me.\n[doctor] You're welcome. Now, let's get those tests scheduled, and I'll see you again once we have the results. Take care, and don't hesitate to call if you need anything before our next appointment.\n[patient] Will do. Thanks again, Doctor.\n[doctor] Have a good day, Mohammed. We'll speak soon.",

    "transcript": "[doctor] Good morning, Charlotte. What brings you in today?\n[patient] Hi, Doctor. I've been experiencing some unusual fatigue and occasional dizziness over the past few weeks.\n\n[doctor] I see. Can you tell me a little more about when you first noticed these symptoms?\n[patient] It started about a month ago. I thought I was just overworked, but it hasn't gone away.\n\n[doctor] Have you made any changes to your routine or diet recently that could be contributing to this?\n[patient] Not that I can think of. I've been trying to eat healthy and keep up with my usual exercise.\n\n[doctor] Okay. And how about your current medications? Are you still taking Dabigatran and Aspirin?\n[patient] Yes, I am. I take 150mg of Dabigatran twice a day and 81mg of Aspirin daily.\n\n[doctor] Alright. Have you been consistent with taking them as prescribed?\n[patient] I have. I'm very diligent about my medication schedule.\n\n[doctor] Good to hear. Do you have any history of heart or blood pressure issues?\n[patient] My mother has a history of hypertension, but I've been fine so far.\n\n[doctor] Alright. Let's check your vitals. Please roll up your sleeve.\n[patient] Sure.\n\n[doctor] Blood pressure looks a bit on the lower side. That could be contributing to your dizziness. Have you noticed any patterns in when the dizziness occurs?\n[patient] It's usually in the morning when I get up or if I stand too quickly.\n\n[doctor] That sounds like it could be orthostatic hypotension. Let's also get a heart rate reading. Hmm, it's slightly irregular. We'll need to monitor that. Have you experienced any chest pain or palpitations?\n[patient] No chest pain, but I've felt my heart flutter a few times.\n\n[doctor] Okay, Charlotte. I want to run some blood tests to check your hemoglobin levels and thyroid function, among others. It's important to rule out anemia or any thyroid issues that could explain your symptoms.\n[patient] I understand.\n\n[doctor] In the meantime, it's crucial to stay hydrated and maybe ease into standing up from a sitting or lying position. This can help manage the dizziness.\n[patient] Got it. I'll make sure to do that.\n\n[doctor] Now, regarding the Dabigatran, it's an anticoagulant, and it's important that we keep an eye on how it's affecting you. Have you had any bleeding issues or bruising?\n[patient] A few bruises here and there, nothing out of the ordinary though.\n\n[doctor] That's expected, but if you notice any increase in bruising or any bleeding that doesn't stop, you'll need to let us know immediately.\n[patient] Will do.\n\n[doctor] And the Aspirin, while it's a low dose, we still have to be cautious given that you're also on Dabigatran. It increases the risk of bleeding.\n[patient] I remember you mentioning that when you prescribed it.\n\n[doctor] Good. Now, have you noticed any swelling or pain in your legs? Any redness or warmth to touch?\n[patient] No, nothing like that.\n\n[doctor] Great. No signs of deep vein thrombosis then. We still need to be vigilant given the Dabigatran.\n[patient] I'll keep an eye out for any changes.\n\n[doctor] Excellent. Now, let\u2019s talk about your lifestyle and diet. You mentioned you're trying to eat healthily. Can you give me an example of your daily meals?\n[patient] For breakfast, I usually have oatmeal with fruit, lunch is typically a salad with some protein, and dinner is a lean meat with vegetables.\n\n[doctor] That sounds quite balanced. How about caffeine intake or alcohol consumption?\n[patient] I have a cup of coffee in the morning, but that's about it for caffeine. I rarely drink alcohol, maybe a glass of wine once in a while.\n\n[doctor] Alright, that's good. Excessive caffeine or alcohol can sometimes exacerbate symptoms like dizziness.\n[patient] I see. I'll keep that in mind.\n\n[doctor] Now, Charlotte, stress can also play a role in how you're feeling. How would you describe your current stress levels?\n[patient] It's been high. Work has been very demanding lately, and I've been feeling the pressure.\n\n[doctor] Stress management is key. Have you tried any relaxation techniques or exercises?\n[patient] I do yoga occasionally, but perhaps I should make it a more regular practice.\n\n[doctor] Yoga can be quite beneficial. Additionally, other techniques like deep breathing or meditation might help with stress reduction.\n[patient] I'll give them a try.\n\n[doctor] Good. Now, I'm going to schedule you for an EKG to check your heart rhythm more thoroughly, especially because of the irregularities we noted and your medication. We want to ensure there are no underlying issues that need to be addressed.\n[patient] Okay. When should I come in for that?\n\n[doctor] We'll try to get you in this week. My assistant will coordinate with you for the best time. If anything changes with your symptoms before then, please call us immediately.\n[patient] Will do, doctor.\n\n[doctor] Is there anything else you're concerned about today that we haven't discussed?\n[patient] Not that I can think of. I just want to feel better and manage these symptoms.\n\n[doctor] Understandable. We'll do our best to get to the bottom of this. Once we have your test results, we'll have a more complete picture and can adjust your treatment plan as needed.\n[patient] Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your help.\n\n[doctor] You're very welcome, Charlotte. Take care, and we'll be in touch soon regarding your appointments and test results. Have a good day.\n[patient] You too, goodbye.\n\n[doctor] Goodbye, Charlotte.",

    "transcript": "[doctor] Good morning, Aiden Barnes.\n[patient] Morning, Doctor.\n[doctor] It's nice to meet you. How have you been feeling?\n[patient] I\u2019ve been better, to be honest.\n[doctor] I see. What brings you in today?\n[patient] I've been having some persistent headaches and occasional dizziness for the past few weeks.\n[doctor] Alright, let's explore that. How often do you experience these headaches?\n[patient] Almost daily. The dizziness isn\u2019t as frequent but happens a couple of times a week.\n[doctor] Understood. And on a scale from one to ten, how would you rate your headache pain?\n[patient] It varies, but when it peaks, it\u2019s around a seven.\n[doctor] That's quite high. Have you noticed anything that triggers them?\n[patient] Not that I can tell. They seem to come on regardless of what I\u2019m doing.\n[doctor] Okay. And how about the dizziness? Any patterns there?\n[patient] It usually hits when I stand up too quickly.\n[doctor] That could be orthostatic hypotension. It's a form of low blood pressure that happens when you stand up from sitting or lying down. It can cause dizziness and lightheadedness. Now, you're currently on Hydrochlorothiazide and Lisinopril, correct?\n[patient] Yes, that\u2019s right. Hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg once daily, and Lisinopril 10 mg once daily.\n[doctor] How long have you been on these medications?\n[patient] For about six months now.\n[doctor] And have you been taking them consistently?\n[patient] Yeah, I take them every morning with breakfast.\n[doctor] Good, good. Let's check your blood pressure to see how that's doing.\n[patient] Sure.\n[doctor] [After checking] Your blood pressure is a bit on the lower side today. It's possible that the medications are causing your blood pressure to dip too low, which might explain the dizziness. We might need to adjust the dosages. Have you experienced any other symptoms? Perhaps coughing or swelling in the extremities?\n[patient] No coughing, but now that you mention it, my ankles do seem a bit swollen at times.\n[doctor] That\u2019s important to note. Swelling can be a side effect of these medications as well. Let\u2019s do a quick physical examination. I\u2019ll also listen to your heart and check your lungs.\n[patient] Okay.\n[doctor] [After examination] Everything sounds normal in your chest, and I don\u2019t see any signs of fluid retention in your lungs, which is good. Your heart rhythm is regular too. I'd like to run some blood tests to check your kidney function and electrolyte levels, as the medications you're on can affect those. And we should probably get an ECG to check on your heart's electrical activity, just to be thorough.\n[patient] That sounds fine. When should I do these tests?\n[doctor] We can have our lab technician take care of the blood draw today, and we can schedule the ECG immediately afterward. Now, regarding the headaches, have you noticed any changes in your vision or sensitivity to light and sound?\n[patient] Not really, but I do get more irritated by noise when I have a headache.\n[doctor] That can be common with headaches of a higher intensity. Given the persistence and severity of your symptoms, I\u2019d also like to schedule you for a brain MRI. It\u2019s important to rule out any serious underlying causes for your headaches.\n[patient] I understand. I just hope it\u2019s nothing too serious.\n[doctor] It\u2019s best to be cautious. I want to ensure we\u2019re not missing anything. Additionally, I'd like you to keep a headache diary. Write down when the headaches occur, their intensity, duration, and anything you've eaten or any activity you've done that day. This information can be crucial in diagnosing the type of headaches and identifying triggers.\n[patient] I can do that. Should I come back to see you with the results of these tests?\n[doctor] Yes, let's schedule a follow-up appointment for two weeks from now. By then, we'll have the results from your blood tests, ECG, and the MRI. Based on those, we'll decide if we need to adjust your medication or explore other treatment options.\n[patient] Got it. Is there anything I should do in the meantime, especially about the headaches?\n[doctor] For now, you can take over-the-counter pain relief like acetaminophen or ibuprofen as needed, but don\u2019t exceed the recommended dosage. Try to avoid any known headache triggers, like stress or certain foods, and stay hydrated.\n[patient] I'll give that a try. And what about work? I have a pretty demanding job.\n[doctor] If possible, I'd recommend taking short breaks during the day, especially if you\u2019re working on a computer. It may help to reduce the frequency of your headaches. If the headaches become unbearable or if you experience any new or worsening symptoms, don\u2019t hesitate to contact me or come in sooner.\n[patient] Will do, Doctor. Thank you for your help.\n[doctor] Of course, Aiden. We\u2019re here to make sure you get the care you need. I\u2019ll have my assistant print out the lab requisition for the blood tests and schedule the ECG and MRI for you. Do you have any other concerns or questions before we finish up?\n[patient] No, that covers everything.\n[doctor] Alright, then. Take care, Aiden, and I\u2019ll see you in a couple of weeks. We\u2019ll get to the bottom of this.\n[patient] Thanks, Doctor. See you soon.\n[doctor] Have a good day, Aiden. Remember, if anything changes, let us know right away.\n[patient] I will. Goodbye.\n[doctor] Goodbye.\n\n(Note: This synthetic transcript is a fictional scenario created for illustrative purposes and does not represent actual medical advice or patient information.)",

    "transcript": "[doctor] Good morning, Sophia. It\u2019s good to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last visit?\n[patient] Hi, Doctor. I've been doing okay, I guess. Just the usual ups and downs.\n[doctor] Okay, let\u2019s dive a little deeper into that. But before we start, I want to make sure we have everything up-to-date in your file. I see you're currently on Amlodipine 5 mg and Lisinopril 10 mg, is that correct?\n[patient] Yes, that's correct.\n[doctor] Have you been taking them regularly?\n[patient] I have, every morning, like clockwork.\n[doctor] Great to hear that, Sophia. Have you noticed any changes in your symptoms since starting these medications?\n[patient] Well, my blood pressure has been under better control, but sometimes I feel a bit dizzy if I stand up too quickly.\n[doctor] That could be a side effect of the Lisinopril, especially if you\u2019re dehydrated or haven\u2019t eaten enough. Make sure you\u2019re drinking plenty of fluids and maintaining a balanced diet. Now, tell me, any new health concerns since our last visit?\n[patient] Not really new, but the headaches are still a problem. They haven't gotten any worse, but they haven't improved either.\n[doctor] I see. And how often are these headaches occurring?\n[patient] It's about two or three times a week, usually in the afternoons.\n[doctor] Alright, we might need to look into that further. But first, let's do a quick review of your medical history. You have a diagnosis of hypertension and chronic migraines, correct?\n[patient] Yes, that\u2019s right.\n[doctor] Any history of diabetes or heart disease in your family?\n[patient] My father has type 2 diabetes, and my grandmother had heart disease.\n[doctor] Okay, it's good that you're aware of these family risks. Let's get some vitals. Nurse, can you please check Sophia's blood pressure and heart rate?\n[nurse] Sure, Doctor. Sophia, could you please extend your arm for me? Thank you. Alright, your blood pressure is 128 over 82, and your pulse is 74. Both are looking good.\n[doctor] Excellent. Those numbers are a good sign that the Amlodipine and Lisinopril are doing their job. Now, Sophia, can you tell me about your diet and exercise routine?\n[patient] I've been trying to eat healthier, more fruits and vegetables, less salt. For exercise, I've been taking brisk walks most evenings, about 30 minutes.\n[doctor] That\u2019s very good to hear. A healthy lifestyle can have a significant impact on managing hypertension. Let\u2019s talk about the headaches a bit more. Can you describe them for me?\n[patient] They usually start with a dull ache on one side of my head and then get progressively worse. Sometimes I get sensitive to light, too.\n[doctor] Those are fairly typical migraine symptoms. Have you identified any triggers?\n[patient] Stress seems to be a big one, and if I miss a meal, that can set one off too.\n[doctor] Stress management and regular meals are key, then. We might also consider a preventive medication for the migraines if they continue to interfere with your daily life. How has your sleep been?\n[patient] It's been okay. I sometimes have trouble falling asleep, though.\n[doctor] Insufficient sleep can exacerbate migraines and affect blood pressure. Have you tried any relaxation techniques before bed, like reading or deep breathing exercises?\n[patient] I've tried listening to some soothing music which helps a little.\n[doctor] That\u2019s a good approach. Now, have you been monitoring your blood pressure at home?\n[patient] Yes, I have a machine at home. It's usually around the same as what the nurse just measured.\n[doctor] Great. It\u2019s important to keep track of that. Let\u2019s do a quick physical examination. I\u2019m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath for me. And again. Good, everything sounds clear. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes and muscle strength.\n[patient] Sure.\n[doctor] Everything seems normal there. Next, I\u2019d like to check your eyes, especially since you\u2019ve been having migraines with light sensitivity. Please follow the light with your eyes. Good. Your pupils are reacting normally. Now, let\u2019s talk about managing your headaches. Since stress is a trigger, have you considered any stress reduction techniques like meditation or yoga?\n[patient] I've thought about yoga, but I haven't really tried it yet.\n[doctor] It might be beneficial for you. Reducing stress can have a positive impact on both migraines and blood pressure. In addition, I'd like to order some blood work to check your overall health, including kidney function, since you're on Lisinopril. We\u2019ll also check your cholesterol levels and thyroid function, as these can impact your symptoms.\n[patient] Okay, that sounds good.\n[doctor] I'm also going to prescribe a low dose of a beta-blocker, which can help prevent migraines. It\u2019s also safe to take with your current medications. We'll start you on Propranolol, 20 mg daily. Please be aware of any side effects, such as fatigue or dizziness, and report back if you experience any.\n[patient] Alright, I'll keep an eye out for that.\n[doctor] Excellent. I'll send the prescription to your pharmacy. Now, regarding the dizziness, make sure you're getting up slowly from sitting or lying down positions. And stay hydrated, especially on hot days or when you\u2019re exercising.\n[patient] Will do, Doctor.\n[doctor] Do you have any questions or concerns about the new medication or anything else we\u2019ve discussed today?\n[patient] No, I think I\u2019ve got it all. Just to recap, I\u2019ll keep taking my Amlodipine and Lisinopril, start the Propranolol, and try to incorporate some stress-reducing exercises into my routine.\n[doctor] That\u2019s right, Sophia. And don't forget to monitor your blood pressure at home. I\u2019ll look forward to seeing the results from your blood work. We'll have you come back in three months to re-evaluate everything, sooner if you have any issues. And please reach out through the patient portal if you have any questions in the meantime.\n[patient] I will, thank you for your help today.\n[doctor] You're welcome, Sophia. It's important to me that we manage these health issues effectively. Take care, and the nurse will be in shortly with the paperwork for your blood work.\n[patient] Great, see you next time.\n[doctor] See you then, Sophia. Have a good day.",

    "example_transcript": "[patient] alright thanks for coming in today i see on my chart here that you had a bunch of lower respiratory infections so first tell me how are you what's going on\n[doctor] you know i'm doing better now but you know last week i was really sick and i just have had enough like i was coughing a lot a lot of mucus even had some shortness of breath and even a low-grade fever\n[patient] wow that is a lot so what did you do for some of those symptoms\n[doctor] you know i ended up drinking a lot of fluid and taking some robitussin and i actually got better over the weekend and now i'm feeling much better but what concerns me is that i i tend to get pneumonia a lot\n[patient] okay so when you say a lot like how frequently does it occur i would say it seem honestly it seems like it's every month or every other month especially over the past six six months that i just keep getting sick and i usually will end up having to go to my primary care doctor or\n[doctor] urgent care and i'll get prescribed some antibiotics and one time i actually ended up in the emergency room\n[patient] wow and how long do your symptoms normally last for\n[doctor] you know it could be as few as like a couple of days but sometimes it could go even up to a week\n[patient] mm-hmm you mentioned that you are a farmer did you do you notice that your symptoms occur while doing certain things on the farm\n[doctor] you know i was trying to think about that and i've been working on the farm for some time but the only thing i can think about is that i've been helping my brother out and i've been started like unloading a lot of hay which i do n't usually do and i wan na say that my symptoms actually start the days that i'm unloading hay\n[patient] alright do you wear a mask when you're unloading hay\n[doctor] no i do n't do that\n[patient] okay\n[doctor] none of us do\n[patient] okay yeah so like that your brother does n't either\n[doctor] no i'm the only one who seems to be getting sick\n[patient] alright so i know you said you were trying to like help out your brother like what's going on with him\n[doctor] you know we've just been getting really busy and so he has been working around doing other things so i've just been helping him just cover the extra load\n[patient] mm-hmm okay alright do you have any other siblings\n[doctor] yeah there is actually ten of us\n[patient] wow okay that's that's a lot of siblings\n[doctor] yeah i'm okay\n[patient] maybe maybe we could we could always stick them in they could get some work done the holidays must be fun at your place\n[doctor] yeah we do n't need to hire any i mean have anyone else this is our family\n[patient] you're right keep it in the family okay so speaking of family do you have do you or anyone have a history of seasonal allergies\n[doctor] no no i have never had any problems with allergies\n[patient] okay and do you smoke\n[doctor] i do n't smoke\n[patient] do you live with anybody who does\n[doctor] i do not\n[patient] okay alright so okay so now i i wan na go ahead and do my physical exam i'm gon na call out some of my findings just to make sure that i'm documenting everything and if you have any questions about what it is that i'm saying please feel free to ask okay\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] so i reviewed your vitals and you appear to be breathing a little fast your respiratory rate is twenty but but your oxygen is you're satting kind of fine at ninety nine percent on room air so i'm not too worried about that on for on your heart exam i do you have a regular rate and regular rhythm i do not appreciate any murmurs rubs or gallops on your lung exam you know i do you do have some fine rales on your lung exam but no wheezes and on your musculoskeletal exam i do not appreciate any clubbing of your fingers so for your results i did review the results of your chest x-ray and i noticed some round glass opacities so let me tell you a little bit about like my assessment and plan for your first problem of recurrent lung infections your symptoms seem consistent with a condition we call hypersensitivity pneumonitis in your case another name is farmer's lung which you know is appropriate considering your job this could be caused by bacteria and or mold that is found in the hay when you inhale it it leads to an allergic reaction in your lungs this is why your symptoms occur every time you move hay for your current symptoms i'm gon na prescribe you a a course of an oral steroid this will help to decrease the inflammation that is occurring in your lungs i will also be ordering a cat scan of your lungs which will help confirm the diagnosis as as well a pulmonary function test to assess how severe your respiratory impairment is it would be best if you could eliminate your exposure to the hay or prevent further to prevent further damage to your lungs however if you are unable it's very important that you wear a respirator when moving hay around i know that that was a lot of information i think it boils down to pull in more of your siblings to help work around but do you have any questions\n[doctor] yeah so is this gon na help so i do n't keep getting sick\n[patient] so ideally what we are doing i think this is the best course of action to deal with the deeper problem right of these infections and to kind of like clear up the pneumonia everything seems to hint on so what we're gon na do is treat your current infection we're going to either prevent you from being around hay or make it so that it's safe for you to be with hay and then we're gon na see like what we need to do moving forward does that help\n[doctor] okay it does\n[patient] alright\n[doctor] thank you\n[patient] okay no problem\n[doctor] alright",
    "transcript": "[Doctor] Good morning, Liam Johnson! How have you been feeling since our last appointment?\n\n[Liam] Morning, Doctor. Honestly, not too great. I\u2019ve been experiencing some discomfort and a few new symptoms that I wasn\u2019t expecting. \n\n[Doctor] I'm sorry to hear that. Can you describe the new symptoms you\u2019re experiencing?\n\n[Liam] Sure, I've been getting these headaches, and they\u2019re pretty persistent. I also have this odd rash that popped up a few days ago. It's itchy and kind of spread across my chest.\n\n[Doctor] Okay, let's take a closer look at that in a moment. Now, you mentioned at our last consultation that you were prescribed Azithromycin. How has that been going?\n\n[Liam] Yeah, I've been taking the Azithromycin as prescribed. I believe it was 500 mg once daily for the first day, then 250 mg once daily for the next four days. I just finished the course yesterday.\n\n[Doctor] Alright, good. It's important to complete the antibiotic course to prevent any resistance. Have you noticed any improvement in the symptoms that led to the prescription of Azithromycin?\n\n[Liam] Well, the cough has definitely subsided, and I'm not feeling as fatigued, which is a relief. But these new symptoms have thrown me off.\n\n[Doctor] That's understandable. Let's go ahead and do a physical examination to get a better understanding of what's going on. I'll also need to check if there\u2019s any relation to the Azithromycin or if it's something unrelated. \n\n[Liam] Sounds good, Doctor.\n\n[Doctor] First, let\u2019s check your vitals. Blood pressure and heart rate look normal. No fever, which is good. Now I\u2019m going to examine the rash you mentioned. Hmm, it\u2019s a bit raised and widespread, but it doesn't look like a typical drug rash. Have you been exposed to anything new that you can think of? New detergents, soaps, or perhaps been in contact with any plants or animals?\n\n[Liam] Not that I can recall. I\u2019ve been mostly at home, keeping things pretty consistent to avoid any issues while on the medication.\n\n[Doctor] Alright, no worries. We\u2019ll get to the bottom of this. Now, for the headaches \u2013 can you describe them to me? Are they throbbing, sharp, localized?\n\n[Liam] They're more like a dull, constant ache. Mostly around my temples and sometimes behind my eyes. It\u2019s been making it hard to concentrate at work.\n\n[Doctor] I see. Do you have any history of migraines or frequent headaches?\n\n[Liam] No, nothing like that. This is pretty new to me.\n\n[Doctor] Okay, we're going to run some tests to rule out any potential causes. It's possible that the rash and headaches are unrelated, but we'll do a full blood panel, check your liver and kidney functions, and also look for any signs of infection or allergic reactions. I'll also prescribe an antihistamine to help with the rash and itching.\n\n[Liam] That\u2019s reassuring, thanks. Do you think the Azithromycin could have caused this?\n\n[Doctor] It\u2019s possible, though it\u2019s not a common side effect. However, every patient reacts differently to medication. We\u2019ll monitor your symptoms closely and make sure we\u2019re treating you correctly.\n\n[Liam] I appreciate that. Should I be worried about the headaches? Could they be a sign of something serious?\n\n[Doctor] Most headaches aren't indicative of serious conditions, especially if there are no other neurological symptoms like vision changes or difficulty speaking. But we're being thorough to ensure we don't miss anything.\n\n[Liam] Understood. How soon should I expect some relief from the antihistamine for this rash?\n\n[Doctor] Typically, you should see improvement within a few days. If the rash persists or worsens, please give us a call right away.\n\n[Liam] Got it. And in the meantime, should I avoid anything specific?\n\n[Doctor] Try to avoid known allergens and irritants, like strong soaps or lotions. Also, stay hydrated and get plenty of rest to help your body recover.\n\n[Liam] Will do. Is there anything else I should be doing at home?\n\n[Doctor] Just keep a note of any other symptoms that may arise, and maintain a balanced diet to support your immune system. Also, it might be helpful to jot down anything new you eat or any new products you use, just in case we need to identify potential allergens.\n\n[Liam] Alright, I can do that. When do I come back for a follow-up?\n\n[Doctor] Let's schedule you for two weeks from today to review the test results and see how you're responding to the antihistamine. However, if your symptoms change or if the headaches become severe, don't hesitate to come in sooner.\n\n[Liam] Sounds good, I'll make sure to do that.\n\n[Doctor] Perfect. I've sent the prescriptions to your pharmacy and the lab requisition to the front desk. They'll schedule your blood draw before you leave today. Do you have any other concerns or questions for me today, Liam?\n\n[Liam] No, I think that covers everything. Thank you for being thorough.\n\n[Doctor] Of course, it's important to me that we address all your health concerns. Take care, Liam, and we'll see you in a couple of weeks.\n\n[Liam] Thank you, Doctor. See you then.\n\n[Doctor] You're welcome. Have a great day.\n\n[Liam] You too. Goodbye.\n\n[Doctor] Goodbye, Liam.",

    "transcript": "[doctor] Good morning, Mason. How have you been feeling since your last visit?\n[patient] Hi Doctor, it's been a bit rough, but I'm hanging in there, thanks.\n[doctor] Well, I'm glad you're here so we can discuss any concerns. What seems to be the most pressing issue today?\n[patient] I've been dealing with a lot of pain lately, and the medications don't seem to be as effective.\n[doctor] I see. You're still on Paracetamol and Codeine, correct? Can you tell me the dosages you're taking?\n[patient] Yes, that's right. I've been taking 500mg of Paracetamol and 30mg of Codeine every six hours as needed for the pain.\n[doctor] Okay, Mason. Have you noticed any side effects from these medications?\n[patient] I've felt a bit drowsy sometimes, and my stomach has been upset a few times, which is unusual for me.\n[doctor] Understood. We might need to review your pain management plan. But first, let's go through a general check-up. How's your appetite and sleep?\n[patient] My appetite's been okay, but sleep has been elusive with the discomfort. I find it hard to find a comfortable position at night.\n[doctor] That's concerning. Rest is important, especially when you're dealing with pain. Have you noticed any weight changes?\n[patient] Not that I've noticed. I've been trying to maintain a balanced diet despite everything.\n[doctor] That's good to hear. How about your energy levels and mood? Any changes there?\n[patient] My energy's been low, probably because of the poor sleep. And my mood... I guess I've been a bit down because of the constant pain.\n[doctor] That's understandable. Chronic pain can certainly affect one's mood. Let's move on to a physical examination. Please sit here, and we'll start with checking your vitals. Your blood pressure is slightly elevated today, but that could be related to the pain you're experiencing. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs now, okay?\n[patient] Sure, go ahead.\n[doctor] Your heart sounds are normal, and your lung sounds are clear. Now, I'm going to palpate your abdomen. Let me know if you feel any discomfort.\n[patient] A little tenderness on the right side, but nothing too bad.\n[doctor] I'll make a note of that. It could be due to the medication or something else that we need to investigate. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes and the strength in your limbs. Everything seems normal there. Have you experienced any numbness or tingling?\n[patient] No, nothing like that.\n[doctor] Good. Mason, I'm concerned that your current pain management isn't optimal. We need to address this so it doesn't impact your quality of life. Let's discuss your pain further \u2014 can you describe it for me?\n[patient] It's a constant ache in my joints, especially in the mornings and at night. Sometimes it's a sharp pain if I move a certain way.\n[doctor] Have you tried any non-pharmacological methods, like heat or cold therapy, or any exercises?\n[patient] I've used a heating pad, which helps a bit. I haven't tried much exercise; I'm worried it might make things worse.\n[doctor] It's important to stay as active as possible within your pain limits. Physical therapy could be beneficial. We can look into that. Now, regarding your medications, we might need to adjust the dosages or try something new. I want to be cautious with the Codeine due to its potential for dependency and side effects.\n[patient] I was worried about that too. I don't want to rely on it more than necessary.\n[doctor] That's a valid concern. We have other options we can explore, such as non-opioid pain relievers or even certain antidepressants that can help with chronic pain. We'll need to find a balance that manages your pain but minimizes side effects and risks. How do you feel about trying a different approach?\n[patient] I'm open to it. I just want some relief, and I trust your judgment.\n[doctor] I appreciate that, Mason. For now, let's reduce the Codeine to 15mg and see if we can supplement your pain management with a low-dose antidepressant, which can sometimes help modulate pain. We'll also continue with the Paracetamol but monitor you closely for any stomach issues. I'd like to add a once-daily dose of an NSAID with a protective agent for your stomach lining to see if that helps with the inflammation.\n[patient] That sounds like a plan. What are the next steps, then?\n[doctor] I'll give you a prescription for the new regimen. We'll start with Amitriptyline 10mg at night for the pain and mood; it may also help improve your sleep. For the NSAID, let's go with Naproxen 250mg twice daily, and we'll include a proton pump inhibitor like Omeprazole to protect your stomach from potential irritation. We'll schedule a follow-up in four weeks to assess how you're doing with these changes. If you have any concerns before then, don't hesitate to call us.\n[patient] I will. Thank you for taking the time to go through all this with me.\n[doctor] Absolutely, it's important that we manage this effectively. Now, I'd also like to order some blood tests to rule out any other underlying conditions that might be contributing to your pain. And if you're amenable, I'd like to refer you to a physical therapist who specializes in pain management.\n[patient] That sounds good. Whatever you think will help.\n[doctor] Excellent. I'll have my assistant set that up for you, and they'll also assist with the prescriptions and the blood work order. Is there anything else you'd like to discuss today?\n[patient] No, I think we've covered everything. I'm just hopeful that these changes will make a difference.\n[doctor] I'm hopeful as well, Mason. We'll work together on this. Do you have any questions about the new medications or the referral?\n[patient] Not at the moment, but I'll be sure to call if something comes up.\n[doctor] Please do. Alright then, let's get everything finalized for you. I'll see you in a few weeks, but remember, we're here if you need anything before then.\n[patient] Thanks, Doctor. I appreciate it.\n[doctor] You're welcome, Mason. Take care, and we'll see you soon. Nurse, let's get the paperwork ready for Mason Lee and ensure the referrals and prescriptions are in order. Thank you.",

    "transcript": "[doctor] Good morning, Mohammed, how have you been feeling since our last visit?\n\n[patient] Hello Doctor, honestly, I've been better. I've been experiencing some consistent headaches and a bit of dizziness lately.\n\n[doctor] I'm sorry to hear that. Can you tell me how often these headaches occur?\n\n[patient] It seems to be happening several times a week, usually in the afternoons.\n\n[doctor] Alright. Have you noticed anything that might trigger them? Perhaps certain activities or stress?\n\n[patient] I haven't been able to pinpoint anything specific, no.\n\n[doctor] Okay, let's make a note of it. Now, I see from your chart that you're currently taking Cetirizine. How much are you taking and how often?\n\n[patient] I take 10 milligrams once daily for my allergies.\n\n[doctor] And have you been taking Cetirizine regularly, as prescribed?\n\n[patient] Yes, every day without fail.\n\n[doctor] Good. Have you experienced any relief from your allergy symptoms with Cetirizine?\n\n[patient] Yes, it has helped a lot with the sneezing and itching.\n\n[doctor] Excellent. Now, back to your headaches, do you experience any other symptoms with them? Nausea, light sensitivity, or anything else?\n\n[patient] I do feel a bit of nausea, and there's some sensitivity to light. It gets pretty uncomfortable.\n\n[doctor] I see. Have you taken anything for the pain?\n\n[patient] Just over-the-counter ibuprofen, but it doesn't always help.\n\n[doctor] Understood. Do you have any history of migraines in your family?\n\n[patient] Not that I'm aware of, doctor.\n\n[doctor] Alright. What about your sleep patterns? How have you been sleeping?\n\n[patient] My sleep has been quite erratic. I've been staying up late due to work stress, I suppose.\n\n[doctor] Sleep is very important, Mohammed. It could be contributing to your headaches. We should try to address that. Now, tell me, have you made any recent changes to your diet or lifestyle?\n\n[patient] Not really, I've been keeping to my usual routine, though I've been skipping breakfast more often due to rushing in the mornings.\n\n[doctor] It's important to maintain a balanced diet. Skipping meals can sometimes lead to headaches due to drops in blood sugar levels. We'll need to keep an eye on that. Let's do a quick physical examination and check your vitals.\n\n[doctor conducts physical exam]\n\n[doctor] Your vitals look normal, which is good. I'm going to order some blood work to rule out any potential issues like anemia or thyroid problems that could be causing your headaches and dizziness. We should also consider scheduling you for an eye examination, as vision problems can sometimes manifest as headaches.\n\n[patient] I understand. Is there anything I should be doing in the meantime?\n\n[doctor] Well, I'd like you to try to regulate your sleep pattern, even if it means setting an alarm to remind you to go to bed. Also, try not to skip breakfast, even if it's something small. Keeping a headache diary might help us identify any patterns or triggers.\n\n[patient] I can do that.\n\n[doctor] Great. Now, about the Cetirizine, you're taking the standard dose, which is appropriate. However, if you feel your allergy symptoms are not fully controlled, we can discuss adjusting the dosage or trying a different antihistamine.\n\n[patient] I think the Cetirizine is working fine for my allergies, it's just these headaches now.\n\n[doctor] Understood. I want to monitor you closely, Mohammed. Once we have the results from the blood tests and have ruled out other causes, we might need to consider other treatments or a referral to a specialist if these headaches persist. But let's take this one step at a time.\n\n[patient] I appreciate that, doctor. Is there anything else I should be aware of with Cetirizine? Any side effects that could be contributing to my headaches?\n\n[doctor] Cetirizine is generally well-tolerated, but in some people, it can cause drowsiness or fatigue. It's less likely to cause headaches, but everyone's body reacts differently to medication. Keep taking it as prescribed, but if you notice any worsening of symptoms or new side effects, please let me know immediately.\n\n[patient] Will do, doctor.\n\n[doctor] Good. Now, let's schedule a follow-up appointment for two weeks from now. By then, we'll have your test results, and we can discuss the next steps. The receptionist will also provide you with the information for a local optometrist for that eye exam.\n\n[patient] Okay, I'll make sure to schedule that eye exam.\n\n[doctor] Excellent. And remember to start that headache diary. It could provide us with valuable information.\n\n[patient] Understood, I'll start on that today.\n\n[doctor] Alright, Mohammed. Take care, and we'll see you in two weeks. If anything changes or you have any concerns, don't hesitate to call our office.\n\n[patient] Thank you, doctor. I appreciate your help.\n\n[doctor] You're welcome. Have a good day, Mohammed.\n\n[patient] You too, goodbye.\n\n[doctor] Goodbye.",

of note , the patient underwent an aortic valve replacement and ascending aortic aneurysm repair on 1/22/2013 . regarding his blood work from 4/10/2021 , the patient's alkaline phosphatate- phosphatase , excuse me , was elevated to 156 . his lipid panel showed elevated total cholesterol of 247 , hdl of 66 , ldl of 166 , and triglycerides at 74 . the patient's tsh was normal at 2.68 . his cbc was unremarkable . his most recent vitamin d level was at the high end of normal at 94 .\n[doctor] good morning , mr. walker . how are you doing ? i mean , it's been a crazy year .\n[patient] i'm doing fine , for the most part , but there are a few things i want to cover today .\n[doctor] sure . go right ahead .\n[patient] uh , well , i'm having more fatigue , but i do n't know if it's age or if it's just , you know , drained at the end of the day . but i still ride my bike . i ca n't go as fast as i used to . i'm still riding , and , you know , after a long bike ride , i'll sit down and then boom . i'm out , you know ?\n[doctor] yeah . what's a long bike ride to you ?\n[patient] uh , 20 to 30 miles .\n[doctor] 20 to 30 miles on a road bike ?\n[patient] yeah , road bike . i think it's a time thing . if i had more time , i would try to do my 40 miles , but i have n't done that . obviously , we're too early in the season so my typical ride is , like , 20 , 30 . in years back , i could do 40 on a good day . i can still do 20 but , you know , i'm tired and have to take a break when i get home .\n[doctor] yeah , i understand .\n[patient] and tyler's my buddy . he's always nice and waits for me , but i used to be able to beat him . but now , he waits for me all the time . he's older than me and it- it kills me .\n[doctor] yeah , i can imagine that would upset me too .\n[patient] well , the last time , you know , you found a heart thing , then . just making sure that the valve is holding out , you know ?\n[doctor] right . so , when was your last stress test ?\n[patient] it was september 9th , 2019 , because i'm eight years out from surgery , and back then , they said , you know , it's going to last eight years . and i'm at that year , so i just want to make sure . i asked dr. lewis for an echocardiogram to see how i'm doing .\n[doctor] yeah .\n[patient] but it's not ... like , nothing has changed drastically since i saw you .\n[doctor] okay , good . do you still go down to hopkins at all ?\n[patient] no , not at all . i just get follow-ups intermittently , here . going there is just ... it's too much stress .\n[doctor] okay .\n[patient] one more thing , i want to make sure i do n't forget . my wife and friends tell me that when i walk , i purse my lips when i'm breathing . other doctors have said , \" did you notice your pursed lips breathing ? \" i do n't know if that's a bad habit or what .\n[doctor] okay . is there any wheezing associated with that ?\n[patient] no , no wheezing .\n[doctor] and you're able to bike 30 miles and mostly keep up with your friend , tyler , correct ?\n[patient] yeah . the only other thing i want to mention is it's not like i do routine testicular exams , but i know i have this little nodule on my right testicle .\n[doctor] on the testicle or the epididymis ?\n[patient] epididymis . uh , i really do n't know . i'm not super concerned . i read a little online . just wanted to ask you .\n[doctor] and did you have a vasectomy ?\n[patient] no . let me pull my notes out and make sure i mentioned everything i wanted to tell you . those were the only things and it's not like my tiredness is depression or anything . i'm a pretty happy guy overall , you know ? i just know you would ask those questions .\n[doctor] what time are you going to sleep , and about how many hours do you sleep a night ?\n[patient] um , it varies . usually , i get six to seven hours of sleep . i get out of bed some days to be at work by 7:00 , lecture , and i try to work out in the morning . i- i do n't ... i'm not ... i'm not always successful , and now what i do is i- i do make reservations twice a week for a 5:45 swim in the morning .\n[doctor] okay , so you're getting six to seven hours of sleep , and has your wife ever mentioned if you snore or stop breathing at any time ?\n[patient] i believe i snore a little bit , but she's never said anything about me not breathing .\n[doctor] okay . so , you're currently taking vitamin d3 , around 5000 units on sundays , and two thous ... or 50,000 units on sundays , excuse me , and 2000s on the other six days , and then clindamycin prior to dental procedures , correct ?\n[patient] yeah , that's right .\n[doctor] have you had a covid-19 shot yet ?\n[patient] i've received both . my first dose on january 15th , '21 and my second on february 5th , '21 .\n[doctor] good . if you'd hop up here on the table , we're just going to do a physical exam .\n[doctor] well , mr. walker , overall you're doing well . i'm going to order an echocardiogram and a stress test . i also recommend that you follow up with cardiology , i think dr. vincent sanchez would be a great fit for you .\n[patient] all right .\n[doctor] also your recent labs showed an elevated alkaline phosphatase level at 156 . now this could be related to your liver but most likely related to your bone health . we're going to check a few labs today .\n[patient] you're going to have them done today ?\n[doctor] yes , sir , and we will send the results through your patient portal unless something is way off then we'll give you a call .\n[patient] sounds good .\n[doctor] now as far as your breathing , i observed the pursed lip breathing and your exhalation is low . i think you should do a pulmonary function test to further evaluate , and i'll order that as well .\n[doctor] now the nodule in your right testicle should be evaluated by urology , and we will place that referral today , also .\n[patient] sounds like i'm going to be busy getting this all checked out .\n[doctor] yes , sir . now you are due for your mmr and i'm recommend you get the shingles vaccine as well . you have completed your covid-19 , so that's good .\n[doctor] now i'm going to have , uh ... have you return in about a year for your wellness visit . we'll see you back sooner if needed after i review all those labs and those other studies .\n[doctor] do you have any other questions for me ?\n[patient] no , doc . i think you covered it all .\n[doctor] great . okay , the nurse will , uh , be back in a minute to give you mmr today , and the front desk will line up a time to do the shingles vaccine next month .\n[patient] thanks , doc . have a great day .\n[doctor] all right , i used my general physical exam template for respiratory notate : pursed lip breathing , low exhalation phase , clear to oscillation , no wheezing . uh , genitalia notate : right testicle with two to three millimeters palpable nodule does not feel as if it will ... does not feel as if with the epididymis or variococele ; left testicle , normal ; no hernia . all other portions of the physical exam are normal default .\n[doctor] assessment history of the aortic aneurysm repair : the patient underwent and aortic valve replacement and ascending aortic aneurysm repair on 1/20/2013 . he is doing well overall and currently asymptomatic . he is currently not seen by cardiology routinely . suggest the following up and suggested vincent sanchez as his physician . we will perform an echocardiogram , eh , slash , stress test .\n[doctor] elevated alkaline phosphatase level . most recent cmd showed elevation at 156 . this could be related to his liver but most likely re- related to his bone health . i've ordered an alkaline phosphatase and again a gt .\n[doctor] lung field abnormal finding on exona ... excuse me , on examination . the patient has been noted to purse his lips while breathing . he was found himself ... he has found himself feeling more fatigued at the end of the day . he does bicycle around 20 to

    "transcript": "[doctor] Good afternoon, Carter Phillips. It's good to see you again. I have your chart here and I see you were born on June 12, 1965. How are you feeling today?\n\n[patient] Hi, Doctor. I've been better, to be honest. I've been dealing with some new issues I wanted to discuss with you.\n\n[doctor] Of course, Carter. We'll address each of your concerns. Before we dive in, let me just confirm that you're still taking Pregabalin 75 mg twice a day and Duloxetine 60 mg once daily. Is that correct?\n\n[patient] Yes, that's correct. I've been on those for my fibromyalgia and the associated pain and depression symptoms.\n\n[doctor] Alright. How have you been feeling on those medications? Any side effects or new symptoms that you've noticed?\n\n[patient] Well, the medications do help with the pain, but I've been feeling quite drowsy lately. I'm not sure if it's the Pregabalin or the Duloxetine causing it.\n\n[doctor] Drowsiness can be a side effect of both medications, but we can look into adjusting the dosages if it's becoming too much of a problem for you. Now, tell me more about the new issues you mentioned.\n\n[patient] I've been experiencing some occasional heart palpitations and a bit of shortness of breath, especially when I climb stairs or do any physical exertion.\n\n[doctor] I see. Have you noticed any patterns or triggers for these palpitations, or do they seem to happen randomly?\n\n[patient] They seem pretty random to me. I can't pinpoint anything specific that sets them off.\n\n[doctor] Alright, we'll definitely want to investigate that further. Have you had any changes in your weight, appetite, or sleep patterns?\n\n[patient] My appetite has been pretty normal, but my sleep has been a bit erratic. I wake up several times during the night, and I'm not sure why.\n\n[doctor] It's important to get a good night's sleep, especially with fibromyalgia. Poor sleep can exacerbate pain and fatigue. Have you been under any unusual stress or had any major life changes recently?\n\n[patient] My job has been more stressful than usual, but nothing I haven't managed before. No significant life changes.\n\n[doctor] Okay, Carter. Stress can contribute to sleep issues and palpitations, so it's something to be mindful of. Now, let's do a physical examination and check your vital signs. Please, take a seat on the examination table.\n\n[patient] Sure, Doctor.\n\n[doctor] Your blood pressure is a bit elevated today, 142/90. It's something to keep an eye on. Have you been monitoring your blood pressure at home?\n\n[patient] I have a machine, but I haven't been as consistent as I probably should be.\n\n[doctor] It would be helpful if you could take readings twice a day and bring them in next time. Now, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Please take deep breaths for me... Good. Your heart sounds are normal, but I do hear some mild wheezing in your lungs. Have you had any coughing or wheezing episodes lately?\n\n[patient] I've had a bit of a dry cough, nothing too bad, though.\n\n[doctor] Okay, we'll keep an eye on that. It could be related to the shortness of breath you mentioned. I'm going to order a chest X-ray to rule out any lung issues. Also, given your palpitations, I think it would be wise to have an EKG performed today. We'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results.\n\n[patient] Sounds good, Doctor. Is there anything else we should look at?\n\n[doctor] We should do some routine blood work to check your thyroid function, electrolytes, and complete blood count. Imbalances there can sometimes cause palpitations and fatigue. Given your fibromyalgia, I'd also like to check your vitamin D levels, as deficiencies are common and can contribute to pain and fatigue.\n\n[patient] Okay, that makes sense.\n\n[doctor] Now, how is your pain management? Are you finding any relief with the current regimen?\n\n[patient] The pain is manageable most days, but there are times when it flares up and it's hard to deal with.\n\n[doctor] Have you been able to continue with any physical activity or exercise?\n\n[patient] I try to walk a few times a week, but I haven't been able to do much more than that.\n\n[doctor] Exercise, even gentle movement like walking, can be beneficial for managing fibromyalgia symptoms. But listen to your body and don't push too hard. Now, about the medications, we can consider adjusting the Pregabalin and Duloxetine if you feel the drowsiness is impacting your quality of life. We might try lowering the Pregabalin first to see if that helps, as it's more likely to cause sedation.\n\n[patient] I'd be willing to try that. I just don't want the pain to get worse.\n\n[doctor] We'll be cautious with any adjustments. For now, let's reduce the Pregabalin to 50 mg twice a day and keep the Duloxetine the same. We'll schedule a follow-up in a month to see how you're doing with the change.\n\n[patient] Alright, I trust your judgment, Doctor.\n\n[doctor] Do you have any other concerns or questions for me today?\n\n[patient] No, I think we've covered everything. I just hope we can figure out what's causing the palpitations and shortness of breath.\n\n[doctor] We'll do our best to get to the bottom of it, Carter. Remember to schedule your follow-up appointment on your way out, and don't hesitate to call if you have any issues before then.\n\n[patient] Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your help.\n\n[doctor] You're welcome, Carter. Have a good day, and take care.\n\n[patient] You too, goodbye.\n\n[doctor] Goodbye, Carter. Nurse, could you please come in and help Mr. Phillips with scheduling his tests and follow-up appointment? Thank you.",

    "transcript": "[doctor] Good morning, Daniel. How have you been feeling since our last visit?\n\n[patient] Hi, Doctor. I've been okay, I guess. Some days are better than others.\n\n[doctor] I understand. Just to recap, Daniel Hill, you're 45 years old and have been on Infliximab and Methotrexate for your rheumatoid arthritis. How are you managing with the medications?\n\n[patient] The Infliximab infusions every eight weeks have been going smoothly. I haven\u2019t noticed any adverse reactions, and it seems to help. The Methotrexate, though, I\u2019m taking 15 mg once a week, and it makes me feel a bit nauseous sometimes.\n\n[doctor] Nausea is a common side effect of Methotrexate. Have you been taking folic acid supplements to help with that?\n\n[patient] Yes, I take folic acid the day after the Methotrexate like you suggested, which seems to ease the nausea a bit.\n\n[doctor] Good, good. I'm glad the folic acid is helping. How about your joint pain and stiffness? Any improvement there?\n\n[patient] The pain is less intense than before we started the Infliximab, and the stiffness in the morning has improved slightly, but it's still there.\n\n[doctor] That's promising to hear. Remember, it can take some time for the full effects of the medications to become apparent. Have you noticed any signs of infection or unusual bruising since these medications can affect your immune system?\n\n[patient] Not really, no infections, and no unusual bruising that I\u2019ve noticed.\n\n[doctor] Excellent. It's important to stay vigilant and report any such symptoms immediately. Let's check your vital signs. Nurse, could you please take Mr. Hill's blood pressure and temperature?\n\n[nurse] Of course. Daniel, please roll up your sleeve. Your blood pressure is 130 over 85, and the temperature is normal at 98.6\u00b0F.\n\n[doctor] Thank you. Daniel, your blood pressure is slightly elevated but within an acceptable range considering your condition. We'll keep monitoring it. Now, let's talk about your mobility. How is that going?\n\n[patient] It\u2019s a bit of a struggle. Some days I can move around just fine, but there are times when my joints feel too stiff, especially in my hands and knees.\n\n[doctor] Mobility can be a challenge with rheumatoid arthritis. It's crucial to stay as active as possible without overexerting yourself. Have you been able to keep up with the physical therapy exercises?\n\n[patient] I try to do them every day. They do seem to help with flexibility.\n\n[doctor] That\u2019s good to hear. Keep up with those exercises. They\u2019re vital for maintaining your joint function. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical examination. I'll start by checking your joints for any swelling or tenderness. Please let me know if you feel any discomfort.\n\n[patient] Sure, go ahead.\n\n[doctor] (After examination) Alright, Daniel, I can see some mild swelling in your knuckles and wrists, which is to be expected. Your knee reflexes are normal, and there are no signs of joint deformity, which is positive. How about your diet and overall nutrition? Are you managing to eat well?\n\n[patient] I\u2019ve been trying to eat healthier, lots of fruits and vegetables, and I cut down on sugar.\n\n[doctor] That's excellent. A balanced diet is crucial in managing rheumatoid arthritis. It can help reduce inflammation and maintain a healthy weight to reduce strain on your joints.\n\n[patient] I\u2019ve also been reading about omega-3 fatty acids being good for inflammation. Should I be taking supplements?\n\n[doctor] Omega-3s can be beneficial. You can get them from fish like salmon or through supplements. However, please consult with me before starting any new supplement to ensure there's no interaction with your current medications.\n\n[patient] Got it. I\u2019ll check with you first.\n\n[doctor] Now, let's review your blood test results from last week. The liver enzymes are a bit elevated, which can be a side effect of Methotrexate. We'll need to monitor that closely. Your inflammatory markers have decreased since starting Infliximab, which is a good sign that the treatment is effective.\n\n[patient] That\u2019s a relief to hear.\n\n[doctor] Definitely. However, we\u2019ll continue to keep an eye on your liver function. If necessary, we can adjust the Methotrexate dosage. Are you due for your next Infliximab infusion soon?\n\n[patient] Yes, it\u2019s scheduled for next Thursday.\n\n[doctor] Perfect. Make sure you don't miss that appointment. Now, I want to ensure you're up to date with your vaccinations, especially since your immune system is compromised. Have you received your flu shot this year?\n\n[patient] Not yet, I was going to ask you about that.\n\n[doctor] I recommend you get it as soon as possible. I can have the nurse administer it today if you're comfortable with that.\n\n[patient] That would be great, thank you.\n\n[doctor] Nurse, please prepare a flu shot for Mr. Hill. While we take care of that, do you have any other concerns or symptoms you\u2019d like to discuss?\n\n[patient] Well, I\u2019ve been feeling a bit more fatigued than usual. Is that related to my medications or the rheumatoid arthritis itself?\n\n[doctor] Fatigue can be related to both your condition and the medication. It\u2019s important to balance rest and activity. Make sure you're getting enough sleep at night and consider short rests during the day if needed.\n\n[patient] I\u2019ll try to do that. Is there anything else I need to be doing at home?\n\n[doctor] Continue with your current regimen, including your physical therapy exercises, and make sure you're following the recommended diet. Also, remember to manage stress as it can exacerbate your symptoms. Techniques like meditation or gentle yoga can be quite beneficial.\n\n[patient] I\u2019ll look into that. Thanks for the suggestion.\n\n[doctor] You're welcome. Now, after your flu shot, I'd like to schedule a follow-up appointment in a month to re-evaluate your liver enzymes and discuss how you\u2019re feeling overall. Nurse, can we schedule Mr. Hill for a follow-up?\n\n[nurse] Absolutely, Doctor. I'll set that up before he leaves today.\n\n[doctor] Great. Daniel, I'm here to support you in managing your rheumatoid arthritis. Please don't hesitate to reach out through the patient portal if you have any questions or concerns before our next appointment.\n\n[patient] I appreciate it, Doctor. Thank you for your help today.\n\n[doctor] It\u2019s my pleasure. Take care, Daniel, and I'll see you in a month, if not sooner. Nurse, please finalize Mr. Hill\u2019s notes for today\u2019s visit.\n\n[patient] Goodbye, Doctor.\n\n[doctor] Goodbye, Daniel, and remember, we\u2019re just a message away if you need us.",

the stairs i was doing my laundry and i slipped and i tried to catch myself and i put my arms out to catch myself and then all of a sudden i just my wrist started to hurt real bad and it got real swollen\n[doctor] wow okay so which wrist are we talking about left or right\n[patient] it's my right one of course\n[doctor] okay and then have you ever injured this arm before\n[patient] no i have not\n[doctor] okay alright so on a scale of one to ten how severe is the pain\n[patient] gosh it's like a nine\n[doctor] wow okay have you done anything to ease it\n[patient] yeah i did the ice thing i put ice on it and then i you know i even i have a ace wrap at home i try to do that\n[doctor] mm-hmm\n[patient] and then i took some ibuprofen but it helps a little bit but it's just it's it's just not right\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] really\n[doctor] yeah okay have you sorry i'm trying to think how long ago did this injury happen\n[patient] this happened yesterday morning\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] maybe just you know i just bumped it but\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] it's just not it's really bad\n[doctor] okay no i understand okay so i'm going so you said you were doing laundry\n[patient] yes i had my back hit my basket and for some reason this cold started to kinda fall out a little bit i was trying to catch it i missed a step and i just totally\n[doctor] okay alright any does the pain extend anywhere\n[patient] no not really\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] it's just really along my wrist\n[doctor] okay any numbness any tingling\n[patient] a little one and one ca n't tell if it's just because of the swelling in my wrist but just i can like i can feel it my fingers still\n[doctor] mm-hmm\n[patient] but just maybe a little bit of tingling\n[doctor] okay alright and are you so so okay i'm gon na think on this but in the meantime i'm gon na do my physical exam alright\n[patient] okay\n[doctor] okay so you know looking at your looking at your head and your neck i do n't appreciate any like adenopathy no thyromegaly no no carotid bruit looking at your listening to your heart i do n't appreciate any murmur no rub no gallop your lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally your lower legs you have palpable pulses no lower edema your shoulders every like your upper extremities i see normal range of movement with your right wrist let's go ahead and focus on it so when i push on the inside here does it hurt\n[patient] yes\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] it does\n[doctor] and what about the outside does that hurt as well\n[patient] yeah it does\n[doctor] are you able to move your wrist towards your arm like\n[patient] not without extreme pain\n[doctor] okay so pain on flexion what about extension when you pick your wrist up\n[patient] yeah i have a hard time doing that actually\n[doctor] alright what about we're gon na go ahead and hold your arm like straight like flat and then try and move it sideways does radial deviation hurt\n[patient] yeah\n[doctor] alright and then lateral as well\n[patient] yeah it's really hard to move any direction of this hand for some reason\n[doctor] alright so wrist abduction adduction positive for pain on movement are you able to make a fist\n[patient] hmmm yeah a little bit but i ca n't do it really tight\n[doctor] okay alright okay so i'm just gon na go ahead and feel on your fingers really quickly alright metacarpals intact noticed some obvious swelling ecchymosis obvious swelling and bruising tenderness on palpation throughout there is evidence of potential fracture feeling some bony crepitus alright so this pain is it like chronic i wanted to ask you\n[patient] yeah i would say it kinda goes away when i take that ibuprofen but for the most part i feel it i feel it there and it it's just really really bad when i move it all\n[doctor] okay so when you like is there a position either hurts less or hurts more like say if your arm is raised and elevated over your head does it hurt more or is it just best to keep it like down\n[patient] it's good if i keep it a little bit above my like a little i guess a little bit like around my like just a regular level like if you're typing or something and then i just put it on a pillow and i just let it stay straight like i feel better\n[doctor] okay yeah no i do n't think i understand completely okay so i took a look at your vitals and your blood pressure is a little elevated but honestly that's probably to do with the pain right our body can respond to pain in that way we are looking at like a hundred and forty over over seventy it's not anything crazy but something to mention i see that your heart rate is also a little elevated at like about like eighty beats a minute you are not running a fever so that's great look at ninety ninety seven . two your respiratory rate is pretty normal at like twenty so before we came in i i know that we had you do an x-ray and i'm sure that that was a bit more painful because we had to do so many manipulations but i do wan na note that you are positive for what we call a colles' fracture what that means is that the joints between your wrist like the bones between your wrist that there there is evidence of a a fracture and we are gon na have to treat it a little conservatively at first and then consider some of the options options that are available to us so for your primary diagnosis of a colles' fracture we are going to give you a thumb spica for today and that's going to\n[patient] i'm sorry\n[doctor] pardon what\n[patient] a what\n[doctor] we're gon na brace you we're gon na give you a brace\n[patient] okay thank you\n[doctor] sorry no problem sorry yeah not a thumb spica we're gon na brace your arm and you're gon na have that we we have a couple of options but i think the best course of action is gon na be for surgery we will in the meantime give you pain medication i wan na put you on fifty milligrams of ultram every six hours and then i also wan na get you on get you into physical therapy a few weeks after surgery this is gon na be just a normal procedure you will be in for an overnight stay but after that once we assess and make sure that everything is good you'll be able to go home okay\n[patient] when do i have to have the surgery\n[doctor] we would like it to happen as quickly as possible you know your body is a wonderful miracle and it's going to start trying to heal on it's own what we need to do is get your wrist straight and then like put screws in to make sure that we hold it in place or else it could like heal and malform\n[patient] okay\n[doctor] alright so what\n[patient] how how long do i have to wear that brace\n[doctor] you're gon na be wearing the brace for about six weeks\n[patient] six weeks\n[doctor] yeah so you're gon na you're gon na come in for your surgery we're gon na perform it you're gon na stay overnight and then you'll be bracing it for six weeks in the meantime you'll also then go to physical therapy i want you there like we're gon na they're gon na do an assessment and determine how much but i'm thinking probably three times a week just to make sure that you can get your wrist as strong as possible to prevent like future injury now the cool thing about getting any kind of a bone break is that your your body comes out even stronger so this should n't happen again but unfortunately like it's these situations that oof that just kind of\n[patient] oof\n[doctor] these these deform these deformities that really that really kind of hurt is the short version alright no problem any other questions\n[patient] no well i am going on vacation do i need to cancel it like can i still go even with the i mean after the surgery\n[doctor] yeah\n[patient] do it as soon as possible i'm going a vacation in a month so\n[doctor] okay how long is the vacation\n[patient] it's only for like a couple weeks\n[doctor] okay well so you might have to postpone it just because depending on what physical therapy says right if they feel that you can sustain if you can like sustain the exercises while you're gone that if there's something that you can do by yourself then you should be fine but we do wan na give it you said that it's gon na happen in a couple of weeks\n[patient] no vacation in a month\n[doctor] okay okay yeah so how about in a month we come you come back let's do a checkup again see where we are at and then we can assess whether or not this is something that i would recommend you do\n[patient] that sounds good thank you\n[doctor] no problem bye\n[patient] bye\n[doctor] the fracture appears extra-articular and usually proximal to the radial ulnar joint dorsal angulation of the distal fracture fragment is present to a variable degree if dorsal angulation is severe presenting with a dinner fork deformity ulnar styloid fracture is present",
    "transcript": "[doctor] Hello Ella, it's great to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last appointment?\n[patient] Hi Doctor, well, I've been feeling a bit off lately. I've been taking the medications you prescribed \u2013 Digoxin, Furosemide, and Spironolactone \u2013 but I'm not sure they're working as expected.\n[doctor] I see. Can you elaborate on what you mean by 'a bit off'? Any specific symptoms or changes since starting these medications?\n[patient] Sure, I've been feeling quite fatigued, a bit dizzy at times, and I've noticed my ankles are swollen more than usual. I've also had some shortness of breath.\n[doctor] Okay, those are important details. Let's start with the medications. What dosages are you on for each one?\n[patient] I take 0.25 mg of Digoxin once daily, 40 mg of Furosemide every morning, and 25 mg of Spironolactone also once a day.\n[doctor] Got it, Ella. And have you been consistent with taking your medications at these dosages every day?\n[patient] Yes, I have. I make sure to take them at the same time each day.\n[doctor] That's good to hear. Now about the symptoms \u2013 fatigue, dizziness, swelling, and shortness of breath. Have you noticed any patterns or triggers for these symptoms?\n[patient] They seem to get worse later in the day, especially if I\u2019ve been on my feet a lot. The dizziness often comes on when I stand up too quickly.\n[doctor] Alright, that's helpful to know. Have you noticed any changes in your weight or your urine output since starting on Furosemide?\n[patient] Actually, now that you mention it, I think I have been urinating more often, and it seems more than before. I haven't really checked my weight, though.\n[doctor] Furosemide is a diuretic, so increased urination is expected, but we need to make sure it's not excessive. When it comes to your weight, it would be helpful to monitor it daily since Furosemide is also supposed to help with the swelling by removing excess fluid.\n[patient] I'll start keeping track of my weight then.\n[doctor] Excellent. Now, let's do a quick physical exam. Please sit comfortably, and we'll start by checking your vitals. [after a moment] Your blood pressure is a bit on the lower side, which could explain some of the dizziness. Your heart rate seems normal, but let's listen to your heart and lungs.\n[patient] Okay, sure.\n[doctor] [after auscultation] I can hear some crackles in the bases of your lungs, which might indicate fluid accumulation. That could be contributing to your shortness of breath. And your heart sounds are a little irregular, which we need to keep an eye on, especially since you're on Digoxin.\n[patient] That doesn't sound too good.\n[doctor] We'll address it, Ella. Now for your legs \u2013 I can see the swelling you mentioned. Does it feel painful or just uncomfortable?\n[patient] Mostly uncomfortable, but my shoes feel tighter, and it's more difficult to walk.\n[doctor] Right, that's likely due to the edema. We may need to adjust your Furosemide dosage, but first, I want to check a few more things. Can you lie down for me so I can check your abdomen?\n[patient] Sure. [lies down]\n[doctor] [after examining] Your abdomen is a bit distended, and there's some tenderness. It's possible you're retaining fluid here as well. Before we make any medication changes, I want to order some tests. We need to check your electrolytes, kidney function, and get an EKG to see how your heart is doing. I'm also considering a chest X-ray to check for fluid in your lungs.\n[patient] That's a lot of tests, but if they're necessary...\n[doctor] They are, Ella. We need to ensure your heart condition is managed effectively and safely with these medications. The tests will guide us in fine-tuning your treatment.\n[patient] Okay, I trust you. When should we do these tests?\n[doctor] I'd like to get them done today, if possible. Our nurses will help you with the arrangements and instructions.\n[patient] Alright, I can stay for the tests. Is there anything I should do in the meantime?\n[doctor] Until we have the results, I want you to monitor your symptoms closely. Keep a log of when you take your medications, your daily weight, and any new or worsening symptoms. Also, try to limit your salt intake, as it can contribute to fluid retention.\n[patient] Will do. And should I continue taking the medications as prescribed?\n[doctor] Yes, continue with your current dosages. However, if you feel your symptoms are significantly worsening, or if you experience any severe side effects like confusion, chest pain, or fainting, please contact us immediately or head to the emergency department.\n[patient] I understand. I'll be careful and let you know if anything changes.\n[doctor] Great. Once we have the test results, we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and decide on any treatment adjustments. And remember, Ella, it's important to stay hydrated, but don\u2019t overdo it with fluids. We don't want to exacerbate the fluid retention issue.\n[patient] I'll keep that in mind. Thank you for being thorough, Doctor.\n[doctor] Of course, it's my job to take care of you. Do you have any other questions or concerns right now?\n[patient] Not at the moment, but I will reach out if something comes up.\n[doctor] Perfect. After your tests, our staff will provide you with a summary of today's visit, along with your test orders and follow-up instructions. Take care, Ella, and we'll be in touch soon.\n[patient] Thanks again, Doctor. See you soon.\n[doctor] Goodbye, Ella. Remember to rest and take it easy until we figure this out.\n\n[End of the synthetic transcript]",

um , my cousin said she had lost some weight , and has been working out every day , but she does n't work , so ... i do n't know .\n[doctor] yes , amino acids are what make up the protein , which is in any food you eat , with any protein . so , meats , dairy , nuts , any of that sort of thing .\n[patient] okay , thank you . got it .\n[doctor] all right . um , are you allergic to any medications ?\n[patient] no , not that i know of .\n[doctor] okay . is your s- skin pretty sensitive ?\n[patient] yes .\n[doctor] all right .\n[patient] um , yeah , my size , i will start getting rashes , with different products .\n[doctor] and have you ever tried clindamycin topical , as an antibiotic for your acne ?\n[patient] no , i've never tried anything for it .\n[doctor] okay . we might give you some of that .\n[patient] okay . and i also want to mention that my feet do swell up a lot .\n[doctor] okay . i'm ... let me take a look at that for just a moment . um , any constipation ?\n[patient] yes , i also do have that problem .\n[doctor] all right . mira- miralax will definitely help with that .\n[patient] okay , yes , my doctor did also recommend that .\n[doctor] great . all right , let's do an exam real quick . please have a seat on this table and i'll listen to your lungs and heart .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] all right , deep breath . all right , again .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] all right , sounds good .\n[patient] great .\n[doctor] let me take a look at your feet and ankles .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] all right , they look okay right now , certainly let your doctor know about this if it gets any worse or reoccurs .\n[patient] okay , i will do that .\n[doctor] now , let's go over your lab work . so , when you took that pill , the dexamethasone test , you passed , which means you do n't have cushing's syndrome . on that test , at least . the salivary cortisol , though , unless you did one wrong ... two of them were completely normal and one was abnormal , so , we might need to repeat that in the future .\n[patient] okay , that's okay .\n[doctor] all right , so , your cholesterol was quite high . the total cholesterol was 222 . the good cholesterol was about 44 . the bad was 153 , and it should be less than 100 . the non-hdl was about 178 , and it should be less than 130 . the good cholesterol should be over 50 , and it was 44 . so , your screen for diabetes is ... was fine . you do have a vitamin d deficiency , and , i do n't know if we started the vitamin d yet , or not .\n[patient] yes , we did . i- i do need to take one today , though .\n[doctor] okay . so , i also checked a lot of other pituitary hormones , iron levels ... everything else seemed to be pretty good , and in decent range .\n[patient] okay , that sounds great . so , i wanted to also show you my liver enzymes , um , because i have n't come back since then ... but i was also happy , because one of them was back to normal .\n[doctor] okay , great . let's see them .\n[patient] okay . so , the one that's 30 , that was almost 200 not so long ago .\n[doctor] yeah , your alt was about 128 .\n[patient] okay , and , and back in october was 254 .\n[doctor] yeah , this is much better .\n[patient] okay , great . and then it dropped in january , and then it dropped a little more in march , since i stopped taking the medicine in december .\n[doctor] okay , that's good . so ... i'm proud of you with the course of your labs , so before i forget , i'm going to , uh , just put your labs into the computer today , and i wo n't be checking your vitamin d level for some time .\n[patient] okay . so , with the thyroid , and the low vitamin d , does that always happen together ?\n[doctor] um , i do have a lot of people that have thyroid , thyroid issues and they have vitamin d deficiency .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] this is what i'm , um , i'm going to do . i'm going to put , print out your prescriptions , so you can shop around at the pharmacies and see if you can find better prices .\n[patient] okay , that way i can go ask them and try cvs .\n[doctor] yeah , that sounds like a plan .\n[patient] okay , good . so , the weight loss study that you mentioned , when does that start ? or , how does that work ?\n[doctor] so , we are about to start , as we just got approval last week , and we are just waiting on our paperwork so we can get started .\n[patient] okay , and what's involved with that ?\n[doctor] so , it'll involve you receiving a medication which has been used for diabetes treatment , and it works mostly in the gut on satiety , or satiety hormones . um , the most common side effects are going to be nausea , vomiting , diarrhea and constipation . they are s- uh , six arms , to the study . one is a placebo , the other ones are a , various as ... various dosages of the medication , excuse me . um , you would receive an injection once a week . also , keep in mind that most of the weight loss medications are not covered by insurance .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] so , it's a way of getting them , but , the odds of getting one of the arms with the medication that are in your favor , right , might be only one out of five of our hundred patients that we have on the list for the study that will receive the placebo .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] does that make sense ?\n[patient] yes , it does .\n[doctor] so , we do expect pretty big weight loss , because of what we learn in diabetes study . so , it's a year long , uh , process , and it's an injection once a week . you come in weekly for the first four , five weeks , i believe . and then , after that , it's once a month . you do get a stipend for partici- for participating in the study , and parking is validated , and whatever else that you need for the study .\n[patient] okay , do you know how much the stipend is ?\n[doctor] um , i will have to double check for you , and , you do n't have to be my patient , you just have to meet the criteria . so the criteria is a bmi greater than 30 , if you do n't have any other medical condition . or , a bmi greater than 27 , if you do have another medical condition , like your cholesterol . um , a bmi greater than 27 would quali- uh , qualify you .\n[patient] i have a friend who might be interested , and she does have diabetes .\n[doctor] if she has d- diabetes , then she wo n't qualify .\n[patient] okay , you ca n't if you ... if you have diabetes , got it .\n[doctor] correct . yeah , the only thing that , um , they can not have , really , is diabetes . so , either a psychiatric disease , or schizophrenia , bipolar , things like that .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] but , if they have hypertension , high cholesterol , things like that ... they can definitely sign up .\n[patient] and they can , okay . thank you for explaining that .\n[doctor] of course . so , do you want me to try to get you into that study ? or , would you just like to try , me to prescribe something ? it's kind of up to you .\n[patient] i think i'll just wait for a little bit now .\n[doctor] all right , sounds good . i'll give you the information for the research , it's just in my office . um , it is a different phone number , though . so then , if you're interested , just call us within a month , because i do n't know how long , uh , the , the wait will be .\n[patient] okay , will do .\n[doctor] perfect . so , let me go grab your discount card for the unithroid . um , when you go in to activate it , the instructions are on this card , and then you use your insurance ... then , show them this , and ask how much it'll cost . if it's too expensive , just let me know .\n[patient] i will . thank you so much for your help on that .\n[doctor] you're welcome . then , what i did is , i gave you a topical antibiotic , plus i gave you the benzoyl peroxide . so , the peroxide may bleach your sheets , but , you want to make sure to take it and apply it at night , so you do n't have a reaction from the sun during the day .\n[patient] okay , i can do that .\n[doctor] but , you do also want to make sure that you do n't mess up your sheets .\n[patient] okay , sounds good .\n[doctor] um , so , that's that . and then , let's see how you do on the other medications . i think this will , this will get better . in the meantime , a low-carb diet , avoid alcohol and fatty foods , and low chole- cholesterol foods .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] and again , once you finish your dose of vitamin d , for the vitamin d deficiency , you're gon na start with the 2000iu daily , so that you're able to maintain those levels . sound good ?\n[patient] yes , that sounds great .\n[doctor] i really think your liver enzymes are going to get better once you lose the weight , though .\n[patient] okay , that would be great .\n[doctor] since we stopped your birth control , we can try once called phexxi , which is kind of like a spermicide , basically .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] and you just apply it before intercourse .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] if you need some , uh , just let me know .\n[patient] okay , i will . i'll let you know .\n[doctor] okay , perfect . so , stay put for me now . i'm going to go see if they have discount samples , and bring you that prescription . and then , i'm going to order the labs for next time .\n[patient] okay , great , thank you so much .\n[doctor] you're welcome .\n[doctor] so , under the plan , under abnormal liver enzymes , they have improved since discontinuation of her birth control . under abnormal weight gain , her dexamethasone suppression test was normal . two out of three salivary cortisol tests were normal , not consistent with cushing's , and therefore we're ruling out cushing's . under her hirsutism , her androgen levels were normal . for the acne vulgaris , the epiduo was not covered , so we'll try benzoyl peroxide with clindamycin , and remove the previous information . on the hyperthyroidism , we'll print out her prescriptions . unithroid should be better priced with the discount card , and we'll repeat levels of everything before next visit . thanks .",
    "transcript": "[doctor] All right, we have Riley Roberts coming in next, date of birth April 2nd, 1990. \n[doctor] Good morning, Riley. How have you been feeling since our last appointment?\n[patient] Hi, Doctor. I've been managing, thanks. A bit of the usual aches and pains, but nothing too out of the ordinary.\n[doctor] I see. Are you still taking the medication we discussed previously? How's the Ibuprofen working for you?\n[patient] Yeah, I'm still on the Ibuprofen. I've been taking 400 mg every four to six hours as needed for the pain. It helps, but it's not perfect.\n[doctor] Understood. We'll review your pain management regimen during today's visit to see if we need to make any adjustments. Any other changes in your health or new symptoms you'd like to discuss?\n[patient] Not really new, but the headaches have been a bit more frequent. I'm not sure if it's related to stress or something else.\n[doctor] Frequency of headaches can indeed be influenced by stress, among other factors. We'll dive into that in a moment. First, let's do a quick review of your medical history. Any hospitalizations or surgeries since we last met?\n[patient] No, nothing like that.\n[doctor] Any new allergies or reactions to medications that you've discovered?\n[patient] Not that I'm aware of. Just the usual seasonal allergies.\n[doctor] Good to know. Now, regarding the increased headaches, can you describe the nature of these headaches? Are they localized, throbbing, accompanied by any sensitivity to light or sound?\n[patient] They're usually a dull ache around my temples. Sometimes light bothers me, but no sensitivity to sound.\n[doctor] And how often are you experiencing these headaches?\n[patient] I'd say about three times a week. They usually come on in the late afternoon.\n[doctor] That's quite frequent. We may want to look into potential triggers or underlying causes for these headaches. But before we do that, let's check some vitals. Nurse, could you please take Riley's blood pressure and temperature?\n[nurse] Of course, Doctor. [A few moments pass.] Blood pressure is 118 over 76, and the temperature is 98.6\u00b0F.\n[doctor] Thank you. Those are normal readings, which is good. I'd like to do a quick physical examination, if that's alright with you, Riley.\n[patient] Sure, go ahead.\n[doctor] [After completing the examination] Everything seems to be in order physically. Now, let's return to your headaches. Have you noticed any relationship between your headaches and your diet or sleeping patterns?\n[patient] Not that I've really noticed. I try to eat healthily and get enough sleep, though my schedule can be a bit erratic.\n[doctor] An irregular schedule can sometimes contribute to headaches. It's important to maintain a consistent sleep pattern as much as possible. Now, when you take Ibuprofen for your headaches, does it alleviate the pain effectively?\n[patient] It takes the edge off, but sometimes I feel like I need something stronger.\n[doctor] I understand. Overuse of Ibuprofen can lead to rebound headaches, where the medication itself can be a contributing factor to headache recurrence. We'll want to ensure we're addressing the root cause of your headaches rather than just masking the symptoms with pain relievers. Have you tried any other forms of pain relief or relaxation techniques, like meditation or gentle exercise?\n[patient] I've tried some yoga, which seems to help a bit with relaxation.\n[doctor] That's excellent. Yoga can be beneficial for both physical and mental well-being. Now, given the frequency of your headaches and the limited relief you're getting from Ibuprofen, I'd like to explore other options. We might consider a trial of a different class of medication for your headaches, perhaps a preventive one if they continue to be a regular occurrence. But before we do that, I'd like to order some blood work to rule out any potential issues that could be contributing to your symptoms. We'll check your complete blood count, thyroid function, and look for any deficiencies, such as vitamin D or iron, which can sometimes be linked to headaches. How does that sound?\n[patient] That sounds good to me. I just want to find out what's causing these headaches and hopefully find a way to reduce them.\n[doctor] Absolutely, that's our goal. While we wait for the results of your blood work, I'd also like to discuss some lifestyle modifications that may help manage your headaches. These include regular exercise, staying hydrated, and perhaps keeping a headache diary to track potential triggers. Have you considered any of these strategies before?\n[patient] I do my best to stay active and drink plenty of water, but I haven't kept a headache diary. That might be useful to pinpoint triggers.\n[doctor] It can be very enlightening. I'll provide you with some guidelines on how to keep an effective headache diary. Now, onto the topic of diet\u2014you mentioned eating healthily. Can you walk me through a typical day's meals for you?\n[patient] Sure, I usually start with oatmeal or yogurt for breakfast. Lunch is often a salad with chicken or fish, and dinner is usually a mix of veggies and protein, sometimes rice or quinoa. I snack on fruits or nuts during the day.\n[doctor] That's a well-rounded diet. I'm pleased to hear you're incorporating a variety of nutrients into your meals. Keep that up. Now, about the Ibuprofen\u2014while it's a good medication for temporary pain relief, we need to be cautious about long-term use as it can have side effects, including gastrointestinal issues. Have you noticed any stomach discomfort since you've been taking it?\n[patient] Sometimes my stomach feels a bit off, but I haven't really connected it to the Ibuprofen.\n[doctor] It's something we should monitor. If you're experiencing stomach discomfort, we might consider a medication to protect your stomach lining while you're taking Ibuprofen or look into alternative pain relief options.\n[patient] I didn't realize that could be a side effect. I'll definitely keep an eye on it.\n[doctor] Good. It's important to be aware of how medications can affect your body, especially with regular use. Now, regarding your exercise routine, you mentioned yoga. Do you engage in any other forms of physical activity?\n[patient] I try to go for walks and occasionally I'll swim. Nothing too strenuous.\n[doctor] Those are great choices for low-impact exercises that can help reduce stress and improve overall health. Regular exercise can also have a positive effect on headache frequency and intensity. Now, Riley, I want to touch on your mental health as well. Stress, anxiety, and depression can all manifest physically, including causing headaches. How have you been feeling in that regard?\n[patient] I've been a bit stressed with work and personal stuff, but I wouldn't say it's any worse than usual.\n[doctor] Stress can be a significant factor in headaches, even if it's a level of stress you feel accustomed to. Have you ever tried any stress management techniques, such as mindfulness or cognitive-behavioral therapy?\n[patient] No, I haven't, but I'd be open to learning more about them.\n[doctor] Excellent. I can provide you with some resources and refer you to a specialist if you're interested. The mind-body connection is powerful, and addressing mental health can often improve physical symptoms.\n[patient] That could be helpful. I'll think about it.\n[doctor] Great. Now let's talk about your support system. Do you have family or friends you can rely on when you're feeling overwhelmed?\n[patient] I do have a good network of friends, and I'm close with my siblings. They're supportive.\n[doctor] That's wonderful to hear. A strong support system can be invaluable for managing stress and health issues. Now, regarding your medication, Ibuprofen, we should consider the long-term plan. If we find that your headaches aren't improving or the Ibuprofen isn't as effective as we'd like, we may explore other medications that are specifically formulated for headache prevention. These can include beta-blockers, antidepressants, or anticonvulsants, which have been shown to reduce the frequency and severity of headaches in some patients. We'll also need to make sure any new medication doesn't interact with other substances you may be taking.\n[patient] I appreciate all the options, Doctor. To be honest, I'm a little wary of starting a new medication, but if it could help with the headaches, I'm willing to consider it.\n[doctor] It's completely normal to have concerns about new medications, Riley. We'll discuss all potential benefits and side effects to help you make an informed decision. And remember, any medication we try would be closely monitored to ensure it's the right fit for you.\n[patient] That's reassuring, thanks.\n[doctor] Of course. Now, let's schedule a follow-up appointment to review your blood work results once they come in. We'll also discuss any changes you've made and how they've affected your headaches. If necessary, we can then talk more about treatment options and whether a referral to a specialist, like a neurologist, might be beneficial.\n[patient] Sounds like a plan. I'll make sure to book the follow-up as I check out today.\n[doctor] Excellent. Before you go, I want to ensure you have all the information you need about potential headache triggers and the importance of a consistent routine. I'll also give you a handout on headache diaries. And here's a prescription for a higher-strength Ibuprofen, should you need it. It's 600 mg, but I want you to use it sparingly, only when the 400 mg isn't sufficient, and not for more than ten days consecutively. If you find you're needing it frequently, we must revisit your pain management strategy.\n[patient] Got it. I'll be careful with it.\n[doctor] Good. I'm glad we could address your concerns today, Riley. Remember, we're here to support you through this. Your health and well-being are our top priorities. If anything changes before your next appointment, please don't hesitate to contact the office.\n[patient] Will do, Doctor. Thank you for all the information and for helping me work through this.\n[doctor] My pleasure. Take care, Riley, and we'll see you soon for that follow-up.",

there is there is several reasons that could be now when i push on your knee does it hurt more on the inside or does it hurt more on the outside here\n[patient] the the right knee here hurts on the outside\n[doctor] okay okay and you've got a good pedal pulse so you know you can feel that and when i touch your feet you do n't have any numbness or tingling or anything like that\n[patient] no uh uh\n[doctor] okay well so what i want to tell you is that i think you have a knee sprain from overuse and we see that sometimes in runners now unfortunately you're gon na have to take some a little bit of time off of of active running but i do n't think it will be that long until we can get you up and running again now i reviewed the x-rays that we did when you first came into the office here this morning and the joint spaces of that right knee are are well maintained i do n't see any evidence of any fracture and when compared to the left knee everything looks good so i do n't even see any signs of any arthritis that i would've been suspecting i would like you to stay on two tylenol five hundred milligrams and two ibuprofen two hundred milligram tablets and i want you to take that three times a day and that's gon na help with both the pain and the inflammation i'm also gon na order some physical therapy for your your right knee and that physical therapy will help strengthen the lower extremities and make it give you a little bit of a balance and some they'll be able to recommend good running exercises for you i do wan na follow up with you in two weeks and see if we're getting better so let's no running for two weeks and if we're we're improving then we'll move on and probably start adding some additional activity does that sound like a plan\n[patient] yeah that does i i was curious so i will lay off the running for now can i you know lift weights and do like my squats and and those type of exercises at the gym\n[doctor] yeah absolutely and and those are good exercises but i'd like you to get that first physical therapy appointment in and they'll be able to talk with you on what the best exercises are for you to do\n[patient] okay got it\n[doctor] any questions\n[patient] hmmm no i do n't think so\n[doctor] okay thank you abigail and i'd like i said stop out at the desk and we'll make an appointment for two weeks\n[patient] okay thanks doctor\n[doctor] thank you",
    "transcript": "[doctor] Good morning, Ella, how have you been feeling since our last visit?\n[patient] Hi, Doctor Martinez. Honestly, I've been better. I've been following the instructions you gave me last time, but I've had some new issues crop up.\n\n[doctor] I see. Can you tell me more about these new issues?\n[patient] Well, I've been feeling really fatigued lately, even more than usual. And I've noticed some swelling in my ankles, too.\n\n[doctor] Swelling, you say? Has the furosemide been helping with that at all?\n[patient] I think it was at first. I'm still taking the 40mg dose you prescribed. But the swelling seems to be getting worse, not better.\n\n[doctor] Okay, that's definitely something we need to look into. How about your breathing? Any shortness of breath or difficulty when you're lying down?\n[patient] Yes, there's been some of that as well. It's harder to get comfortable when I'm trying to sleep.\n\n[doctor] All right, Ella. We're going to need to do a thorough check-up today. Before we proceed, just to confirm, are you currently on any other medications besides furosemide?\n[patient] No, that's the only one at the moment.\n\n[doctor] Got it. Let's start with some basic observations. I'll need to check your blood pressure and listen to your heart and lungs. We should also get some blood work done to check your kidney function and electrolyte levels since furosemide can affect these. I'm also thinking we might need to adjust the dosage or try a different medication to manage these symptoms better. Have you had any issues with urination, like going more or less than usual?\n\n[patient] I've been going more frequently, actually. I thought that was just the furosemide doing its job.\n[doctor] Yes, that's part of how furosemide works, as it's a diuretic. But we want to make sure it's not causing dehydration or electrolyte imbalances. Have you been maintaining a good fluid intake?\n\n[patient] I've been drinking water regularly, but I'm not sure if it's enough. I've been so tired that I don't always remember to drink.\n[doctor] It's important to stay hydrated, especially when taking diuretics like furosemide. We'll address that today. Now, let's have a look at those ankles. Can you roll up your pants for me?\n\n[patient] Sure, here you go.\n[doctor] I'm seeing some pitting edema here. When I press down, it leaves an indent. That's a sign of fluid retention. Have you noticed any weight gain since this started?\n\n[patient] Yes, a few pounds. I thought it was just me not being as active because of the fatigue.\n[doctor] It could very well be related to the fluid retention. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart. Please breathe normally for me. \n\n[patient] Okay.\n[doctor] Your heart sounds a little strained, and I'm detecting some rales in your lungs, which could indicate fluid buildup. Have you had any chest pain or palpitations?\n\n[patient] No chest pain, but sometimes my heart does feel like it's beating too fast.\n[doctor] That's important to note. We'll do an EKG to check for any irregularities in your heart rhythm. Given these symptoms, we need to rule out congestive heart failure, which can sometimes present like this, especially with the fatigue and swelling. I'm going to order a BNP test as well, which is a marker for heart failure.\n\n[patient] Heart failure? That sounds serious, Doctor.\n[doctor] It's a condition we need to take seriously, but it's also manageable with the right treatment. It's too early to jump to conclusions, though. We need to get the full picture before we make any diagnosis.\n\n[patient] What's the next step, then?\n[doctor] After we complete the physical examination, I want you to go to the lab for blood work. We should also schedule an echocardiogram to look at your heart's function. Depending on those results, we might adjust your furosemide dosage or add another medication to help reduce the fluid buildup and support your heart.\n\n[patient] If you change my medication, will there be side effects?\n[doctor] Any medication can have side effects, but we'll monitor you closely. The goal is to find a balance that manages your symptoms with the least impact on your day-to-day life.\n\n[patient] I understand. What can I do in the meantime to help with the swelling and fatigue?\n[doctor] Keep taking your furosemide as prescribed, and I'll give you some guidance on a low-sodium diet, which can help reduce fluid retention. Also, try to elevate your legs when you're sitting to help with the swelling. We need to get you more comfortable and address the fatigue, so conserving your energy is key.\n\n[patient] Got it. I'll try all of that. Thank you, Doctor.\n[doctor] You're welcome, Ella. Remember, managing a potential condition like this is a team effort. You're an integral part of that team, so make sure to keep track of any changes in how you feel and report them to me, okay?\n\n[patient] Will do. I just want to feel normal again.\n[doctor] And I want that for you, too. Let's book a follow-up appointment for two weeks from now. That will give us enough time to get the test results back and see how you're doing with any changes we make today.\n\n[patient] Sounds good. Thanks for your help today, Doctor.\n[doctor] Of course, Ella. We'll get to the bottom of this. Take care, and I'll see you in two weeks. If anything worsens or you have any concerns before then, please don't hesitate to call.\n\n[patient] I won't. Thank you.\n[doctor] Thank you, Ella. Have a good day, and remember to stop by the front desk to schedule your lab tests and follow-up appointment.\n\n[patient] Will do. Goodbye, Doctor.\n[doctor] Goodbye, Ella. Take care.",

millimeter lesion which was located on right inferior back . pathology came back as melanoma .\n[doctor] mrs. jackson , it's good to meet you .\n[patient] likewise , wish it were under better circumstances .\n[doctor] yeah , i hear your dermatologist sent you to me 'cause she found a melanoma ?\n[patient] yes , that's what the biopsy said .\n[doctor] okay and when did you first notice the spot ?\n[patient] my mom noticed it when i was visiting her last month .\n[doctor] i see . and so you went to the dermatologist on april 10th to get it checked out , right ?\n[patient] yes , i wanted to be extra cautious because skin cancer does run in my family .\n[doctor] well i'm really glad you took it seriously and got it checked . who in your family has had skin cancer , and do you know if it was melanoma or was it basal cell or squamous cell ?\n[patient] my mom and her sister , i think they both had melanoma .\n[doctor] okay . do you have any other types of cancer in the family , like breast or ovarian ?\n[patient] my grandfather had pancreatic cancer .\n[doctor] okay , and was that your mom or dad's father ?\n[patient] mother's .\n[doctor] okay . and , um , have you personally had any skin spots in the past that you got checked out and they were cancerous or precancerous ?\n[patient] no , this was the first time i've been to a dermatologist . um , but my primary care doctor looks over all of my moles every year at my physical and has n't said , um , he's concerned about any of 'em before .\n[doctor] good- good . uh , let's go over your medical history from your chart . i have that you're not taking any medications and do n't have any health problems listed , but that you're allergic to augmentin , is that right ?\n[patient] yes , that's correct .\n[doctor] okay , and for social history can you tell me what you do for work ?\n[patient] i own an auto repair shop .\n[doctor] okay and have you ever been a smoker ?\n[patient] yeah , i still smoke from time to time . i started that awful habit in my teens and it's hard to break , but i'm trying .\n[doctor] i'm glad you're trying to quit . uh , what about your surgical history , have you had any surgeries ?\n[patient] i had gall bladder and appendix .\n[doctor] okay , great , we can get your chart up to date now , thank you . and other than the melanoma , how has your health been , any unintentional weight changes , headaches , fatigue , nausea , vomiting , vision changes ?\n[patient] no , i've been feelin' great .\n[doctor] good . well let me take a look at your back here where they did the biopsy if you do n't mind .\n[patient] sure .\n[doctor] okay , i'm gon na describe it in medical jargon what i'm seeing here , so that the recording can capture it , but you and i are gon na go over it together in just a moment , okay ?\n[patient] okay , that's fine .\n[doctor] all right , so on the right inferior back there's a one centimeter shave biopsy site , including all of the dermis with no residual pigmentation . there's no intrinsic or satellite lesions , no other suspicious moles , no axillary , cervical , or supraclavicular lymphadenopathy . there is a soft lymph node in the right groin , but it's nontender , otherwise normal exam .\n[doctor] okay , you can sit up . um , so what i was saying there is that i see your biopsy site , but i do n't see any other s- , um , skin lumps or bumps that look suspicious . uh , i also felt your lymph nodes to see if any of them felt abnormal . there is one in the right groin that felt slightly abnormal . it's very likely nothing , but i do want you to have an ultrasound of that area to confirm it's nothing , um , and , you know , make sure it's nothing that we need to worry about . uh , the reason we're being extra cautious is that melanoma can very rarely metastasize to the lymph nodes . the ultrasound can tell us if we need to look into this further .\n[patient] okay , i should n't worry too much then ?\n[doctor] no , i have a low suspicion that it will show anything .\n[patient] okay , good .\n[doctor] so assuming that the ultrasound is normal , the treatment for you melanoma is to cut out the area where the lesion was . with lesions that are 0.7 millimeters or less , um , and that's what we recommend , and yours was exactly 0.7 millimeters . if it were any bigger , we would have had to do a more complex surgery . but what i recommend for you is what we call a wide local incision , excuse me , excision , meaning that i will make a long incision and then cut out an area a bit wider than your current biopsy site . the incision is long because that's what allows me to close the skin nicely . you'll have a fairly long scar from the incision .\n[patient] okay , that is fine with me , i ca n't see back there anyways .\n[doctor] yeah , your wife can tell you what it looks like and she may need to help care for the incision at it , as it heals . um , but since we're , we are n't doing the more complex surgery , i actually do n't need to see you back unless you want to check in with me or have any problems . however , it is very important that you continue to follow up with your dermatologist regularly so she can monitor you . uh , your dermatologist will check that this one does n't come back , but she'll also check for other lesions that look suspicious . uh , unfortunately , since you've had one melanoma , you're at a higher risk of developing another one somewhere else .\n[patient] yeah , she did say she wants to see me back .\n[doctor] good , and i'm sure she's already told you , but it's very important that you apply sunscreen anytime and anywhere that your skin is exposed to sunlight .\n[patient] yeah , she definitely went over that , um , several times with me .\n[doctor] good . other than that , i think that's all for me . um , we'll get you set up for the ultrasound , the procedure . do you have any questions for me ?\n[patient] um , no i ca n't think of any at this time .\n[doctor] okay , my nurse will be in to get you scheduled , so sit tight . it was very good to meet you .\n[patient] thank you , nice to meet you as well .\n[doctor] please add the following pathology r- , to results . a pathology , shave of right inferior back , malignant melanoma , invasive , superficial spreading . histology , superficial spreading . clark level 4 , breslow thickness 0.7 millimeters , radial growth phase present , vertical growth phase not identified . mitotic features , less than one millimeter squared . ulceration not identified , progression not

    "transcript": "[doctor] Good morning, I have the medical records for Grace Murphy, MRN 8569321. She's a 63-year-old female presenting for a routine follow-up and management of her chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or COPD. According to her chart, she's currently on Tiotropium, 18 mcg once daily. Let's get started.\n[doctor] Good morning, Mrs. Murphy. How have you been feeling since your last visit?\n[patient] Good morning, Doctor. Well, I've had some good days and some not so good days. The breathing is a bit of a struggle at times.\n[doctor] I'm sorry to hear that. Is the Tiotropium helping at all? Have you noticed any improvement in your symptoms since starting it?\n[patient] I think it's been helping a little. I don't feel as short of breath when I'm taking it, but I still have my moments, especially in the mornings.\n[doctor] That's quite common with COPD, unfortunately. How about side effects? Any dry mouth, constipation, or urinary retention?\n[patient] Just a bit of a dry mouth, but I keep some water with me, and it seems to manage it okay.\n[doctor] Good, staying hydrated is important. Let's talk about your inhaler technique. Are you comfortable with how to use it?\n[patient] I think so. I turn the base, breathe out fully, then put the mouthpiece in my mouth and take a deep breath in. After that, I hold my breath for a few seconds before exhaling.\n[doctor] Excellent, that's exactly right. Now, let's move on to your recent symptoms. Have you noticed any triggers or patterns to when your breathing worsens?\n[patient] It seems to be worse when I'm around smoke or strong perfumes. Cold air seems to make it tougher to breathe, too.\n[doctor] Those are all common triggers for COPD exacerbations. It's important to try and avoid them as much as possible. Have you had any episodes of increased coughing or changes in the color or amount of sputum you produce?\n[patient] I've been coughing a bit more the past couple of weeks. The mucus seems thicker, but it's not really changed color, still mostly clear.\n[doctor] It's good that it's clear, but the increase in cough and sputum thickness might indicate an infection or that your COPD is not fully controlled. I'm going to listen to your lungs now, if that's alright.\n[patient] Of course.\n[doctor] [After examination] Your breath sounds are a bit diminished in the lower lobes, and I hear some wheezing. No crackles though, which is good. It's possible you're starting to have a flare-up. We might need to adjust your medication regimen. How have you been with physical activity?\n[patient] I try to stay active, but sometimes I get winded just walking around the house.\n[doctor] It's very important to keep as active as your condition allows. It helps maintain lung function and overall health. We may need to look into pulmonary rehabilitation, which could help you build up more tolerance for activity.\n[patient] What does that involve?\n[doctor] Pulmonary rehab is a program tailored to people with lung conditions. It includes exercise, education, and support to help you breathe to the best of your ability.\n[patient] That sounds like something that could really help me.\n[doctor] I think so too. I'll refer you to a program. Now, let's discuss your support system at home. Do you have anyone to assist you if needed?\n[patient] Yes, my daughter lives nearby, and she's been a great help, especially on the rough days.\n[doctor] That's wonderful to hear. Having a good support system is crucial. How about your nutrition? Are you managing to eat well?\n[patient] I think so. My appetite isn't what it used to be, but I try to eat balanced meals.\n[doctor] Good nutrition will help your body fight infections and stay strong. Do you have any difficulties with swallowing or heartburn that might be affecting your appetite?\n[patient] No, nothing like that.\n[doctor] Excellent. Alright, let's go over your medication again. You're taking Tiotropium, 18 mcg once daily. Are you taking any other medications, over-the-counter or otherwise, that I should be aware of?\n[patient] I take a multivitamin and an over-the-counter allergy pill when my allergies act up, but that's it.\n[doctor] Alright, make sure you let me know if you start any new medications. Some can interact with Tiotropium. Have you received your flu shot this year?\n[patient] Not yet, no.\n[doctor] It's very important for people with COPD to get their flu shot. The flu can cause serious complications for someone with your condition. We can administer the vaccine for you today if you'd like.\n[patient] I suppose that would be wise. I'll take the flu shot.\n[doctor] Good decision. I also want to make sure you're up to date on your pneumonia vaccine. We'll check your records and make sure you're covered there as well.\n[patient] Thank you, Doctor. I didn't realize that was something I needed.\n[doctor] It's part of managing your condition. Now, I'd like to discuss your COPD action plan. Do you have one in place for when your symptoms worsen?\n[patient] I have some information, but I'm not sure what you mean by an action plan.\n[doctor] An action plan is a set of instructions that you follow if your COPD symptoms become more severe. It will tell you when to increase your medications, when to contact me, and when to seek emergency care.\n[patient] No, I don't have anything like that.\n[doctor] Alright, we'll set one up for you. It's very important, especially if you start to have a flare-up. It can help prevent a crisis.\n[patient] That sounds like a good idea. I'd appreciate that.\n[doctor] We'll work on that together before you leave. Also, do you have any issues with sleep? Many people with COPD experience trouble sleeping.\n[patient] Yes, actually. I've been having a hard time getting a full night's rest.\n[doctor] Sleep disturbances can worsen your COPD symptoms and affect your overall health. We may need to consider a sleep study to see if there's something like sleep apnea contributing to the problem.\n[patient] I hadn't considered that. What would that involve?\n[doctor] You would spend a night at a sleep center where they monitor your breathing and other body functions during sleep. It can provide us with valuable information about what's happening when you're at rest.\n[patient] If you think it's necessary, I'm willing to do it.\n[doctor] Great, I'll make a note for a referral. Now, let's discuss your current symptoms. Have you had any fever, chills, or night sweats?\n[patient] No, nothing like that.\n[doctor] Good, that reduces the likelihood of an infection. How about chest pain or palpitations?\n[patient] No chest pain, but I've felt my heart racing a few times when I'm very short of breath.\n[doctor] That can be concerning. I want to order an EKG to check on your heart rhythm and function, just to be safe. It's a simple test that can tell us a lot about your heart health.\n[patient] Okay, if you think it's necessary.\n[doctor] I do. Now, with COPD, it's also important to keep an eye on your mental health. It can be very challenging to deal with a chronic condition. How are you coping? Any feelings of anxiety or depression?\n[patient] Some days are harder than others. I do get anxious when I have trouble breathing, but I wouldn't say I'm depressed.\n[doctor] It's very normal to feel that way with COPD. I want to make sure you have the support you need. I can refer you to a therapist or counselor who specializes in helping patients with chronic illnesses, if you're interested.\n[patient] Maybe. I'll think about it and let you know.\n[doctor] Of course. Take your time. We want to make sure you're getting comprehensive care. Now, let's update your medical history. Any new diagnoses or hospitalizations since your last visit?\n[patient] No, thankfully.\n[doctor] That's good. Are you up to date on your cancer screenings \u2013 like mammograms, colonoscopies, and the like?\n[patient] Yes, I had a mammogram and a colonoscopy last year. Both were normal.\n[doctor] Perfect. It's important to keep up with those, even with your COPD. Now, back to your medications. Are you able to afford your Tiotropium inhaler? Sometimes these medications can be quite expensive.\n[patient] It's been okay so far. My insurance covers most of it.\n[doctor] That's good to hear. If it ever becomes a problem, please let me know. There may be patient assistance programs available to help cover the cost.\n[patient] I will, thank you for letting me know.\n[doctor] You're welcome. Alright, do you have any questions for me, or is there anything else you'd like to discuss?\n[patient] Not at the moment, I think you've covered everything very thoroughly.\n[doctor] Excellent. My nurse will come in to administer your flu shot and get you scheduled for the sleep study and the EKG. She'll also provide you with information about the pulmonary rehabilitation program.\n[patient] Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your help.\n[doctor] It's my pleasure, Mrs. Murphy. We're here to support you in managing your COPD and maintaining the best quality of life possible. I'll see you again in three months unless you need me sooner. Don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns.\n[patient] Thank you. I'll see you then.\n[doctor] Have a good day, Mrs. Murphy. And remember, keep using your Tiotropium as prescribed, and let's try to get you more active with that pulmonary rehab.\n[patient] Will do. Goodbye, Doctor.\n[doctor] Goodbye. \n\n[doctor] Please update Mrs. Grace Murphy's chart to reflect today's consultation. Note the ongoing prescription of Tiotropium, 18 mcg once daily, and ensure all new referrals and tests are scheduled promptly. Also, document the need for a COPD action plan to be created and provided to the patient. Include all necessary education materials on managing COPD, avoiding triggers, and the importance of regular exercise and nutrition. Record the administration of the flu vaccine and the need for follow-up on pneumonia vaccination status. Highlight the consideration for a sleep study referral and potential mental health support as discussed. Make sure to monitor her response to the Tiotropium and any need for adjustment in therapy at her next appointment or sooner if symptoms worsen.",

    "transcript": "[doctor] Good morning, Sophia. How have you been since our last visit?\n[patient] Hello, Doctor. I've been managing, thank you.\n[doctor] Great to hear. Are you comfortable if we begin with your consultation?\n[patient] Yes, of course.\n[doctor] Alright. Sophia Chen, a 34-year-old female, presenting for a routine check-up and evaluation of her current treatment. So, Sophia, tell me how you've been feeling on the Sertraline?\n[patient] It's been okay, I suppose. I've been taking it every day, 50 milligrams like you prescribed. I think it's been helping with my mood overall.\n[doctor] Have you noticed any side effects or concerns since starting the medication?\n[patient] I've had a bit of nausea and some headaches, but they seem to be getting better with time.\n[doctor] It's good that they're improving. Nausea and headaches can be common initially. And how about your sleep and energy levels?\n[patient] My sleep has been a little irregular, but my energy during the day has been pretty steady. I don't feel as fatigued as I used to.\n[doctor] Good, good. That's promising. Now, let's discuss your diet and exercise habits. Have you made any changes recently?\n[patient] I've been trying to eat healthier, more vegetables and fruits, and I've started going for walks in the evenings.\n[doctor] Excellent choices, Sophia. Keeping active and maintaining a balanced diet are key for your overall well-being. Have you noticed any changes in weight or appetite?\n[patient] My appetite has decreased a little, but I haven't noticed any significant weight changes.\n[doctor] Okay, that's not uncommon with Sertraline. We'll keep an eye on it. Now, let's talk about your stress levels and how you're coping with daily activities.\n[patient] I still feel stressed, especially with work, but I think I'm handling it better. I don't feel as overwhelmed as before.\n[doctor] That's a positive sign. It means the Sertraline may be helping with your anxiety. Have you been continuing with the breathing exercises we talked about?\n[patient] Yes, I have. They help a lot when I feel a panic attack coming on.\n[doctor] Excellent. Keep up with those. Now, let's do a quick physical examination. Can you please roll up your sleeve? I'd like to check your blood pressure.\n[patient] Sure, here you go.\n[doctor] Thank you, Sophia. Your blood pressure is within the normal range; that's good. Let's also check your heart rate. Please relax your arm.\n[patient] Okay.\n[doctor] Your heart rate is also normal. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take deep breaths for me.\n[patient] (breathes deeply)\n[doctor] Your heart sounds are regular, and your lungs are clear. That's excellent, Sophia. Now, let me palpate your abdomen. Tell me if you feel any discomfort.\n[patient] Alright.\n[doctor] Everything feels normal here. No signs of tenderness or swelling. I'm also going to check your reflexes and muscle strength, if that's okay.\n[patient] That's fine.\n[doctor] Reflexes are normal and muscle strength is good. Now, I'd like to review some of the lab work we ordered last time. Let's see, your complete blood count and metabolic panel are within normal limits. Your thyroid function tests are also normal, which is great.\n[patient] That's a relief to hear.\n[doctor] Yes, it's important we monitor these, especially when starting a new medication like Sertraline. Speaking of which, I'm happy with how you're responding to the treatment. However, we should discuss the possibility of adjusting the dosage if you continue to experience side effects or if your symptoms don't improve as expected. How do you feel about that?\n[patient] I'm open to it if you think it's necessary.\n[doctor] We'll give it a bit more time and see how you do. If we decide to adjust it, we'll have a detailed discussion about the benefits and potential risks. Now, do you have any questions or concerns you'd like to discuss today?\n[patient] I was wondering about long-term use of Sertraline. Is it something I'll need to take indefinitely?\n[doctor] That's a great question, Sophia. The duration of treatment varies from person to person. It's something we'll assess regularly. Some individuals take it for a year or so, while others may need it for a longer period. We'll tailor the treatment plan to your specific needs and make adjustments as necessary.\n[patient] Okay, that makes sense.\n[doctor] Also, I'd like you to continue monitoring any changes in mood or side effects and report back to me. It's crucial we stay informed so we can manage your treatment effectively.\n[patient] I'll do that. I've been keeping a journal, actually.\n[doctor] That's an excellent practice. It can be very helpful for both of us to track your progress. Now, I'd like to schedule a follow-up in about six weeks to reassess your treatment and to see if any dosage adjustments are needed. How does that sound?\n[patient] That sounds good. I appreciate your help, Doctor.\n[doctor] It's my pleasure, Sophia. Before you go, let's get you set up for your next appointment. And remember, if you have any pressing concerns before then, don't hesitate to contact the office.\n[patient] Will do. Thank you for today.\n[doctor] You're welcome. Take care, and I'll see you in six weeks. Have a great day, Sophia.\n[patient] You too, Doctor. Goodbye.",

    "transcript": "[doctor] Good morning, Jacob. How have you been feeling since our last visit?\n[patient] Hi, Doctor. It's been a bit of a roller coaster, to be honest.\n[doctor] I'm sorry to hear that. Can you elaborate on what you mean by a 'roller coaster'?\n[patient] Well, some days I feel pretty level, but there are times when I feel like my emotions are all over the place. It's unpredictable.\n[doctor] I see. And how has the Risperidone been working for you? Are you still taking the prescribed dosage?\n[patient] Yes, I've been taking the Risperidone. I'm on 2 mg daily right now.\n[doctor] Good, good. Have you noticed any changes or side effects since you started that particular dosage?\n[patient] I think it's helping stabilize my mood, but I've been feeling a bit drowsy and I've put on a few pounds.\n[doctor] Weight gain and drowsiness can be common side effects of Risperidone. We'll monitor your weight and discuss strategies to manage that. Have you experienced any other side effects?\n[patient] Not really, just those. But the drowsiness can be tough during the day.\n[doctor] Understood. We may need to adjust your medication if the drowsiness doesn't improve. But for now, let's continue monitoring it. How about your sleep, Jacob? Are you sleeping well?\n[patient] Sleep's been okay, I guess. Some nights are better than others.\n[doctor] Do you have a routine before bed?\n[patient] Sort of. I try to wind down, maybe read a little.\n[doctor] That's good. A consistent routine can help with sleep quality. Now, let's talk about your diet and exercise. Have you made any changes since our last appointment?\n[patient] I've been trying to eat healthier and I take walks when I can.\n[doctor] Excellent. A healthy diet and regular exercise can contribute positively to your overall wellbeing. Let's also keep an eye on your blood pressure and cholesterol levels, as Risperidone can sometimes affect those.\n[patient] I understand. I'll keep working on it.\n[doctor] Great. Now, are you still experiencing anxiety or any depressive symptoms?\n[patient] I do get anxious occasionally, but it's less frequent than before.\n[doctor] Alright, that's progress. We'll keep tracking that. How about your social interactions? Any changes there?\n[patient] I've been trying to reach out to friends more, maybe go out once in a while.\n[doctor] That's very positive, Jacob. Social support is important. Now, let's discuss your overall treatment plan. Aside from continuing Risperidone, I want to make sure we're addressing all aspects of your health.\n[patient] I agree, I want to feel more balanced and in control.\n[doctor] Good. Now, I'm going to check your heart rate and blood pressure, and then we'll do a quick physical exam. Can you roll up your sleeve for me?\n[patient] Sure, no problem.\n[doctor] Blood pressure looks good, and your heart rate is within normal range. Let's do a quick look at your throat and listen to your lungs and heart.\n[patient] Okay, sounds good.\n[doctor] Throat looks clear, lungs sound normal, and heart rhythm is regular. Everything seems to be in order physically. I want to do some blood work today to check your liver and kidney functions, as well as your lipid profile. It's routine, especially when on medications like Risperidone.\n[patient] Makes sense. Should I go to the lab after this?\n[doctor] Yes, please. The nurse will give you the lab form. Now, regarding your mental health, are you currently seeing a therapist or counselor?\n[patient] Yes, I've been seeing a therapist every other week.\n[doctor] Excellent. Therapy can be very beneficial alongside medication. Let's make sure you continue with those sessions. And how about your support system at home? Is your family aware of your condition and supportive?\n[patient] My family's supportive. We're pretty open about these things, which helps a lot.\n[doctor] That's wonderful to hear. A supportive environment can make a significant difference in managing mental health conditions. Now, I'd like to see you back here in about six weeks, to follow up on the blood work and assess how you're doing with the Risperidone. Does that work for you?\n[patient] Six weeks sounds good. I'll make sure to schedule it on my way out.\n[doctor] Perfect. Before we wrap up, do you have any questions or concerns you'd like to discuss today?\n[patient] Not at the moment, Doctor. You've been really thorough.\n[doctor] Alright, if anything comes up or if you have any issues with the medication, please don't hesitate to call the office. And remember, it's important to take Risperidone consistently to maintain its effectiveness.\n[patient] I will, thank you for the reminder.\n[doctor] You're welcome, Jacob. Take care of yourself, and I'll see you in six weeks. The nurse will come in shortly with your lab form and help you schedule your next appointment.\n[patient] Thanks, Doctor. I really appreciate your help.\n[doctor] It's my pleasure. Have a good day, Jacob.",

    "transcript": "[doctor] Good morning, Alexander. How have you been feeling since our last visit?\n[patient] Hi, Doctor. I've been managing, but I'm still struggling with my mood swings and anxiety.\n[doctor] I see. Before we go further, can you remind me of the dosages for the Venlafaxine and Mirtazapine you're currently taking?\n[patient] Sure. I'm taking 75 mg of Venlafaxine in the morning, and 30 mg of Mirtazapine before bed.\n[doctor] Good, thank you for confirming. Have you noticed any improvements or changes since starting these medications?\n[patient] The Venlafaxine seems to help with the anxiety during the day, but I still feel pretty low in the evenings, even with the Mirtazapine.\n[doctor] Okay, that's helpful to know. Have you experienced any side effects from either medication?\n[patient] Not too much. I've felt a little drowsy in the mornings, which I think might be the Mirtazapine, but that's about it.\n[doctor] That's a common side effect. It's good that it's not too bothersome for you. How about your sleep? Are you finding it easier to fall asleep now?\n[patient] Yes, the sleep has definitely improved. I'm not tossing and turning as much.\n[doctor] Excellent. Sleep is crucial for managing depression and anxiety. Now, how about your appetite and energy levels?\n[patient] My appetite is okay, I guess. I don't always feel like eating, but I manage to. Energy-wise, I'm still feeling pretty sluggish.\n[doctor] That's not uncommon, Alexander. Sometimes these symptoms can take a while to improve even with medication. Have you been able to get out and exercise, or engage in any activities you enjoy?\n[patient] I've been going for walks. I used to enjoy photography, but I haven't had the motivation to pick up my camera lately.\n[doctor] It's good that you're walking. Physical activity can help boost your mood and energy. Perhaps we can look into additional strategies to help with motivation. Now, any thoughts of self-harm or hopelessness?\n[patient] No, nothing like that. It's more just a constant low feeling, like I'm in a fog.\n[doctor] I'm glad to hear there are no thoughts of self-harm, but we certainly want to address that foggy feeling. We might need to adjust your medication or explore other treatment options. Are you open to discussing these?\n[patient] Yeah, I'll try whatever you think might help.\n[doctor] Great. Let's consider a couple of options. One possibility is to increase the dosage of Venlafaxine. Another is to add a different type of medication to work alongside what you're already taking. Some patients respond well to a combination approach.\n[patient] Okay, what would that involve?\n[doctor] It could involve adding a medication that works differently from Venlafaxine and Mirtazapine. For instance, a mood stabilizer or an atypical antipsychotic, which can sometimes help when traditional antidepressants aren't enough on their own.\n[patient] I'm willing to try if you think it'll help. Do those medications come with a lot of side effects?\n[doctor] All medications have potential side effects, but we would start with a low dose and monitor you closely. The goal is to find the right balance with the most benefit and the fewest side effects.\n[patient] That makes sense. How soon do you think I might start feeling better if we change things up?\n[doctor] It varies from person to person, but typically patients start to notice changes within a few weeks. However, it can take several weeks to fully assess the effectiveness of a new treatment plan.\n[patient] I understand. I'm just ready to start feeling like myself again.\n[doctor] And we'll work together to get you there, Alexander. Now, apart from medication, it's also important to consider therapy. Have you given any more thought to starting cognitive-behavioral therapy?\n[patient] I've been reading about it, and it sounds like it could be helpful. I'm open to it.\n[doctor] Excellent. Therapy can be very effective in conjunction with medication. It provides tools to cope with negative thoughts and behaviors. I can refer you to a therapist who specializes in cognitive-behavioral therapy.\n[patient] That would be great. I'm willing to give it a shot.\n[doctor] Good to hear. We'll make sure you get that referral today. Now, let's discuss the practical side of things. If we decide to adjust your medications, we'll need to schedule a follow-up to see how you're doing. How does that sound?\n[patient] That sounds good. I'd like to keep a close eye on things, especially if we're making changes.\n[doctor] Absolutely. We'll schedule a follow-up for four weeks from today. In the meantime, I'm going to write out the prescription for the new medication plan. Also, please remember to call or visit if you have any concerns or if your symptoms worsen before our next appointment.\n[patient] Will do. Thank you for taking the time to go over everything with me.\n[doctor] Of course, Alexander. It's important that we work together on this. Before you leave, I'll have the nurse provide you with some information about the new medication and what to expect. She'll also help you set up the appointment for therapy.\n[patient] Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your help.\n[doctor] It's my pleasure. We're here to support you every step of the way. Take care, Alexander, and I'll see you in a few weeks.\n[patient] Thank you. I'll see you then.\n[doctor] Have a good day, Alexander. Remember, we're just a phone call away if you need anything.\n[patient] I'll keep that in mind. Goodbye.\n[doctor] Goodbye, Alexander. Take care.",

    "example_transcript": "[doctor] hey jean how're you doing today\n[patient] i'm doing alright aside from this foot pain that i have\n[doctor] so i see here that you looks like you hurt your left foot here where you were playing soccer can you tell me a little bit more about what happened\n[patient] yeah so yeah i was playing in a soccer game yesterday and i was trying to steal the ball from another player and she ended up falling directly onto my right foot and i do n't know i i mean i was trying to get around her and my body ended up twisting around her and then i accidentally felt a pain in my foot\n[doctor] okay so have you ever hurt your left foot before\n[patient] no i've had a lot of injuries in soccer but never injured this foot\n[doctor] okay and then so after the fall and the entanglement with the other player were you able to continue playing\n[patient] no i had to stop playing right away and actually being helped off the field\n[doctor] wow okay and what have you been doing for the the pain since then\n[patient] so i've been keeping it elevated icing it the trainer wrapped it yesterday and taking ibuprofen as well\n[doctor] okay alright so without any ibuprofen can you tell me what your pain level is\n[patient] without ibuprofen i would say my pain is a three\n[doctor] okay and then with your ibuprofen can you tell me what your pain level is\n[patient] like a seven eight\n[doctor] okay so how long have you been playing soccer\n[patient] really since i was like four five i've been playing a long time\n[doctor] well that's cool yeah we our our youngest daughter she is almost sixteen and she plays the inner marrial soccer league they are down at the rex center did is that where you started playing or did you guys did you start playing somewhere else\n[patient] yeah just like this local town leak i started playing that way and then played all throughout school\n[doctor] that's\n[patient] high school teams\n[doctor] that's awesome so just out of curiosity with the left foot have you experienced anything like numbness or tingling or or any strange sensation\n[patient] no i have not\n[doctor] okay now if it's okay with you i would like to do a quick physical exam i reviewed your vitals and everything looks good blood pressure was one eighteen over seventy two heart rate was fifty eight respiratory rate was fourteen you are afebrile and you had an o2 saturation of ninety nine percent on room air on your heart exam your regular of rate and rhythm do n't appreciate any clicks rubs or murmurs no ectopic beats noted there on auscultation listening to your lungs lungs are clear and equal bilaterally so you're moving good air i'd like to do a focused foot exam on your left foot so i do see some bruising on the bottom of your foot and on the top of your foot as well now there is associated swelling and i do appreciate tenderness to palpation of your midfoot and you are positive for the piano key test on a neurovascular exam of your left foot you have a brisk capillary refill of less than three seconds dorsalis pedis pulse is intact and strong and you do have motor and sensation that it's intact to light touch now i would like to do a review of the diagnostic imaging that you had before you came in so i do notice a subtle dorsal displacement of the base of the second metatarsal with a three millimeter separation of the first and second metatarsal bases and the presence of a bony fragment in the lisfranc joint space so lem me talk to you a little bit about my assessment and plan now for for the first concern of right foot pain your right foot pain is due to a lisfranc fracture which is a fracture to one of your second metatarsal bones at the top of your foot where the metatarsals meet your cuboids now there are ligaments at the top of your foot so i'm gon na be ordering an mri to assess for injury to any of these ligaments now based on your exam and from what i'm seeing on your x-ray you're most likely going to need surgery of that foot now the surgery will place the bones back in their proper position and using plates and screws will hold them there while they heal and this is gon na allow those bones and ligaments to heal properly it is a day surgery and you will be able to go home the same day and then i'm going to have you follow up with me here in the clinic you'll be in a cast and you will need to use crutches and you will not be able to use that left foot for about six to eight weeks now after that six to eight weeks you will gradually start walking on your foot based on how you tolerate it and we'll see how you do at that point so i do believe you're gon na need surgery i i'm recommending this because there are significant complications to your foot if we do not do this poor bone and ligament healing can lead to losing the arch of your foot and you're becoming flat-footed you also have a high likelihood of developing arthritis in that foot so what i'm gon na do unfortunately you'll be out the rest of the season but we are gon na get you fixed up and ready for next season if you're okay with all of this i'm gon na have the nurse come in and get you started on your paperwork and then i will see you on monday morning and we will get your foot taken care of\n[patient] alright thank you\n[doctor] you're welcome",
    "transcript": "[doctor] Good morning, Jack. How have you been feeling since our last visit?\n[patient] Hi, Doctor. Honestly, not too great. I've been experiencing a lot of discomfort in my chest lately.\n[doctor] I'm sorry to hear that. Can you describe this discomfort for me? Is it more like a pain or a pressure?\n[patient] It's like a heavy pressure, mostly on the left side of my chest. Sometimes it feels like it's spreading to my arm.\n[doctor] Does anything in particular trigger this sensation, or does it occur randomly?\n[patient] It seems pretty random, but I've noticed it happens more often when I try to do anything physical, like climbing stairs or carrying groceries.\n[doctor] Alright, and how long does this discomfort usually last?\n[patient] Only a few minutes each time, but it's been happening more frequently.\n[doctor] Have you been taking your Aspirin and Clopidogrel as prescribed?\n[patient] Yes, I take 75 mg of Clopidogrel daily and 81 mg of Aspirin every morning.\n[doctor] Good, those dosages are appropriate for your condition. Have you noticed any side effects from the medications?\n[patient] No side effects that I can tell.\n[doctor] Okay, Jack. It's important we monitor this closely. Chest discomfort can be a sign of something serious, like heart disease, especially considering you're on antiplatelet therapy. Let's do a thorough check-up today, and we might need some additional tests. Have you experienced any shortness of breath, dizziness, or nausea along with the chest pressure?\n[patient] I've felt a bit out of breath at times, but I thought that was just because I'm not in the best shape.\n[doctor] I understand, but it could also be related to your heart. What about your diet and exercise routine? Have you made any changes recently?\n[patient] I've been trying to eat healthier, more salads and fish, less red meat. As for exercise, with this chest discomfort, I've been scared to do too much.\n[doctor] That's a good start with your diet. It's wise to be cautious with exercise when experiencing these symptoms, but we need to find a balance so you can stay active. Now, tell me about your family history. Is there any history of heart disease or other cardiovascular issues?\n[patient] Yeah, my father had a heart attack in his sixties, and my older brother has been dealing with hypertension.\n[doctor] Okay, that's important information, as it does increase your risk factors. How about stress levels? Have you been under a lot of stress at work or home?\n[patient] Definitely at work. It's been hectic, and I've been putting in a lot of overtime to meet deadlines.\n[doctor] Stress can certainly exacerbate heart-related issues. We'll need to look into strategies to manage that better. I'd like to start by getting an EKG to check your heart's electrical activity and a chest X-ray. Depending on those results, we may need to consider further testing like a stress test or an echocardiogram.\n[patient] Sounds like a plan. I just want to feel better and make sure nothing serious is going on.\n[doctor] Absolutely, Jack. We want to ensure your heart is as healthy as possible. After the EKG and X-ray, we'll discuss the results and our next steps. Now, have you experienced any unusual bruising or bleeding since you've been on Aspirin and Clopidogrel? These medications can increase your bleeding risk.\n[patient] Not that I've noticed.\n[doctor] Good. It\u2019s also crucial that you avoid any activities that could result in injury due to the bleeding risk associated with your medications. Now, let's move on to the physical examination. I'll start by listening to your heart and lungs, then check your blood pressure and pulse, and we'll also do a quick blood draw to check your lipid profile and other relevant markers.\n[patient] Got it. I hope it's nothing too serious.\n[doctor] We\u2019re being thorough to rule out any significant concerns. It's great that you're being proactive about this. Remember, the goal is to keep you healthy and prevent any potential complications. I'll also go over some lifestyle modifications that can support your heart health beyond medication.\n[patient] I appreciate it, Doctor. I'm willing to do whatever it takes.\n[doctor] I'm glad to hear that, Jack. Taking an active role in your health is the best approach. Also, given your symptoms and history, I want to discuss the possibility of starting a beta-blocker, which can help with chest discomfort and protect your heart. But let\u2019s wait for the test results before making any decisions.\n[patient] Understood. You think the chest discomfort could be angina or something?\n[doctor] It's a possibility, which is why we're conducting these tests. Angina is chest pain that occurs when there's a reduced blood flow to the heart muscles. It\u2019s often a warning sign of coronary artery disease. The fact that it occurs with exertion and goes away with rest is characteristic of angina. However, let's not jump to conclusions until we have all the data.\n[patient] Makes sense. I trust your judgment, Doctor.\n[doctor] Thank you, Jack. I'll have my nurse come in to assist with the EKG and to take you for your chest X-ray. Afterward, we'll draw some blood for the lab tests. I'll review everything once we have the results, and then we'll sit down for a detailed discussion about your treatment plan.\n[patient] Sounds good. I'm ready to get started.\n[doctor] Great. Just relax, and we'll take care of you. I'll see you back here after the tests are complete. If you have any questions in the meantime, don't hesitate to ask the nursing staff.\n[patient] Will do. Thanks for your help, Doctor.\n[doctor] You're welcome, Jack. We'll do our best to get you back to feeling well again.",

    "transcript": "[doctor] Good morning, Sophia. How have you been feeling since our last appointment?\n[patient] Hi, Doctor. It's been a bit of a rollercoaster, to be honest. Some days are better than others.\n[doctor] I'm sorry to hear that. I see here in your chart you're currently taking Simvastatin and Ezetimibe for your cholesterol. How has that been going? Any side effects or concerns?\n[patient] Well, I've been on Simvastatin 20 mg and Ezetimibe 10 mg once daily for a while now. I haven't noticed any major side effects, but I can't say if they are making a big difference yet.\n[doctor] That's fairly common with these medications. They work quietly in the background to help manage your cholesterol levels. We'll do some blood work today to see how effectively they're working. Have you been able to maintain a diet low in saturated fats and engage in regular exercise?\n[patient] I've been trying my best with the diet, eating more vegetables and cutting down on red meat. As for exercise, I've been more active, taking walks in the evenings.\n[doctor] Excellent, Sophia. Those lifestyle changes are crucial in managing cholesterol levels alongside medication. Now, let's move on to the main reason for your visit today. You mentioned over the phone that you've been experiencing some discomfort. Can you describe that to me?\n[patient] Yes, for the past week or so, I've been having these headaches. They aren't like my usual tension headaches; they feel more intense and sometimes I feel dizzy.\n[doctor] I see. Can you tell me where exactly the pain is located, and if anything specific triggers the headaches?\n[patient] The pain is usually around my temples. Bright lights seem to make it worse, and sometimes it starts after I've been reading for a while.\n[doctor] Alright. Do these headaches come with any other symptoms? Nausea, visual changes, sensitivity to sound?\n[patient] There's definitely some nausea, and I find myself needing to rest in a dark, quiet room when it gets bad.\n[doctor] That does sound like it could be migraines. But we'll need to do a thorough examination and possibly some tests to rule out other causes. Given your history and medication use, we want to ensure there's no interaction causing these symptoms. Let's do a quick physical examination, and then we can discuss the next steps.\n[patient] Okay, that sounds good.\n[doctor] I'm going to check your blood pressure and heart rate first. Everything looks normal here. Now, I'll have a look at your eyes with this light, and I need you to follow my finger with your eyes. Good, no nystagmus and pupils are reacting as they should. Now, if you could please open your mouth, I'm going to check your throat and glands. No swelling or redness, which is good. I'm also going to palpate your neck and shoulders to check for any tension or tenderness. Let me know if you feel any discomfort.\n[patient] That feels a bit tender, actually, when you press there.\n[doctor] That could be muscle tension contributing to your headaches. We'll keep that in mind. Now, I would like you to lie down so I can palpate your abdomen, checking for any abnormalities. Everything feels normal here as well. You can sit up now. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs with my stethoscope. Breathe in deeply for me, please... and out. Everything sounds clear, which is good. Lastly, let's check your reflexes.\n[patient] That all seems very thorough, Doctor.\n[doctor] It's important we cover all our bases, Sophia. Your physical examination is quite reassuring. No red flags that would suggest anything serious. However, given the new onset of these headaches and their intensity, I would like to order an MRI of your brain to make sure we're not missing anything.\n[patient] An MRI? That sounds serious. Should I be worried?\n[doctor] It's a precautionary step, Sophia. Headaches can have many causes, most of which are not serious, but we perform tests like an MRI to rule out the less common but more serious possibilities. I also want to make sure there's no interaction between your current medications, Simvastatin and Ezetimibe, and your symptoms.\n[patient] Okay, I understand. Better safe than sorry, right?\n[doctor] Exactly. Now, while we wait for the MRI results, let's talk about managing your headaches. I don\u2019t want to prescribe you anything that might interfere with your current meds, so we'll start with some non-pharmacological approaches. I'll also provide you with a headache diary to track your symptoms, which can help us identify any patterns or triggers.\n[patient] That sounds good. I appreciate the cautious approach with the medications.\n[doctor] Absolutely, we need to be mindful of that. I'll also recommend some relaxation techniques and perhaps a referral to a physiotherapist who can work on any muscle tension that might be contributing to your headaches.\n[patient] I'm willing to try anything at this point. Thank you for being so comprehensive.\n[doctor] Of course, Sophia. Your health and well-being are my top priorities. Now, let's get you scheduled for that MRI and the follow-up blood work for your cholesterol medications. We'll have you come back in two weeks to review all the results. If you have any severe headaches before then, or if anything changes, please call the office immediately.\n[patient] Will do, Doctor. Thanks for your help today.\n[doctor] You're welcome, Sophia. Take care, and I'll see you in a couple of weeks. My nurse will come in shortly with the lab requisition forms and to help schedule your MRI.\n[patient] Thank you, Doctor. See you soon.\n[doctor] See you, Sophia. Have a good day.",

some abnormal lab work and why she wanted me to be seen by you today\n[patient] yeah i bet that did make you nervous i i see that she referred you for a low immunoglobulin a level is that your understanding\n[doctor] yeah i mean i do n't even really understand what that means but yeah that's what she told me\n[patient] yeah that's a mouthful\n[doctor] yeah\n[patient] it it's the the one of the antibodies in your body and that that really makes that your body makes to fight infections it's a little bit low i'm happy to explain it a little bit more to you i just have a few more questions okay so let's start again here\n[doctor] i'll do this\n[patient] i i think i would break that\n[doctor] yeah i just saw that\n[patient] if you can do that\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] yeah so we'll we'll just\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] you can leave it the way it is for now i just i think break that up\n[doctor] okay alright so yeah that sounds fine for me\n[patient] yeah i do you know why she checked these levels in the first place that you've been having problems getting frequent infections\n[doctor] yeah yeah i had a recent physical and she did this as part of her my physical i do tend to get infections but i do n't know i i'm so used to it so i do n't know if this is more than usual in the wintertime i get a lot of colds and they do seem to i always say that my colds kind of linger for a long time but i do n't know if it's more than usual\n[patient] okay how about any abdominal infections\n[doctor] diarrhea no\n[patient] frequently\n[doctor] no not that i can not that i say can think of\n[patient] okay what about your family are are anyone in your family that you know have immune deficiencies\n[doctor] no my family is actually pretty healthy\n[patient] okay and how about do you have any other medical conditions\n[doctor] yeah my pcp just started me on metformin i just got diagnosed with type two diabetes\n[patient] okay okay yeah diabetes your family your family owns that donut shop right i mean down at the end of the street\n[doctor] yes and that's probably part of the cause of my diabetes yes\n[patient] yeah well i guess you're gon na have to watch that\n[doctor] i know i know\n[patient] but you know everything in moderation i mean just you know you just need to be careful you ca n't does n't have to go away\n[doctor] right\n[patient] but have you ever needed to receive a blood transfusion or blood products\n[doctor] no i actually tried to give blood but they i did n't qualify because i had recently traveled internationally\n[patient] okay where did you go\n[doctor] i was in zambia\n[patient] hmmm i heard that's beautiful\n[doctor] it's so beautiful it's so beautiful i had a great time\n[patient] okay well let me let me go ahead and do a physical examination here i reviewed your vitals you know that the the assistants collected when you first came in including your weight and everything looks good there there is no fever there there is nothing that i'm concerned about there now on your heart exam you have a nice regular rate and rhythm and i do n't appreciate any murmurs that's kind of those extra sounds that i would hear and that that all sounds good on lungs lung exam your lungs are clear there's no wheezes rales or rhonchi now on your neck exam i do n't appreciate any lymph lymphadenopathy swollen lymph glands and then let me just go ahead and i wan na press on your belly a little bit is that tender anywhere that i press it does n't seem like you making any facial\n[doctor] no\n[patient] no okay so your you know your abdominal exam is your belly is soft there is no tenderness as i i push around there now i did review the results of your recent lab work and it is consistent as as your pcp noted with an iga deficiency that's that immunoglobulin a that we talked about so let me tell you a little bit about the assessment and plan so for your first problem the that a iga deficiency is it very common immunodeficiency your your body makes many different types of antibodies in one of your z iga is just a little bit lower than normal now most of the time people live their entire life without even knowing they have that deficiency and function perfectly normal now some people may find that they get tend to get frequent respiratory tract or sinus or abdominal infections but this does n't necessarily seem to be the case for you now it can go along with other immunodeficiencies but i think there is a low likelihood hood in your case but we're gon na order some additional blood work that includes checking those other antibodies now do you have any questions on what i just told you\n[doctor] yeah so is there anything i need to do or should be watching for or should i be worried\n[patient] no i i really do n't think you need to be worried now we're gon na check these additional studies and that will give us some more guidance but really i think this is just a finding that's common to you and you know it it's many people have have have these type of you know immunodeficiency what i want you to watch for is those infections that do n't stop you have trouble getting it under control or you know any changes to your abdominal tract you know severe diarrhea\n[doctor] anything like that then you know we may want to look at it a little bit further but for now i do n't think there is anything significant we want to do now go ahead and get your lab work and\n[patient] bring you in for that now the only other thing that i would say is if you eat end up needing any blood products between now and when i see you next make sure you tell them that you have that iga deficiency\n[doctor] why is that\n[patient] well there is a risk that your body can strongly react to some blood products and they just need to know that so they're prepared so anytime you get blood just make sure you say that you have a history of a an an iga deficiency\n[doctor] okay okay thank you\n[patient] you're welcome\n[doctor] okay",
    "transcript": "[doctor] Good morning, Sofia. How have you been feeling since our last visit?\n[patient] Not too great, to be honest. I've been having some issues that I wanted to discuss with you today.\n[doctor] I'm sorry to hear that. Why don't you start by telling me a bit more about these issues?\n[patient] Well, I've been experiencing some chest discomfort on and off, and I'm concerned about it.\n[doctor] I see. Have you been using your Nitroglycerin as we discussed?\n[patient] Yes, I have. I take the 0.4 mg sublingual tablets when I feel the pain.\n[doctor] And how often would you say you need to use the Nitroglycerin?\n[patient] Maybe a couple of times a week. It does seem to help, but the fact that the pain keeps coming back is worrying me.\n[doctor] Understandably so. Are there any particular activities that trigger the discomfort?\n[patient] It's hard to say for sure, but I think it happens more often when I'm going up the stairs or carrying something heavy.\n[doctor] Alright, that's good to know. It's important for us to monitor this closely, given your history of angina. Are you experiencing any other symptoms along with the chest discomfort, such as shortness of breath, nausea, or sweating?\n[patient] Sometimes I do feel a bit short of breath, but there's no nausea or sweating.\n[doctor] Okay. Have you noticed any patterns in your symptoms, like time of day or relation to meals?\n[patient] Not really, it seems pretty random to me. Although, now that you mention it, I think it might be a bit worse in the mornings.\n[doctor] Morning exacerbation can be common. How about your energy levels and sleeping patterns?\n[patient] My energy levels have been lower than usual, and I've been having some trouble sleeping through the night.\n[doctor] I understand. We'll need to take a comprehensive look at all these factors. How have you been managing with your diet and exercise?\n[patient] I've been trying to eat healthier and go for walks most days, but with the discomfort, it's been a challenge.\n[doctor] It's good that you're making those efforts. Proper diet and exercise can have a significant impact on your overall cardiovascular health. Now, have you experienced any side effects from the Nitroglycerin?\n[patient] Just a headache after I take it, but it usually goes away after a bit.\n[doctor] That's a common side effect, but if it becomes too bothersome, we can discuss alternatives or adjunctive therapies. Have you been taking any other medications or supplements aside from the Nitroglycerin?\n[patient] No, just the Nitroglycerin.\n[doctor] Alright, Sofia. I want to do a thorough examination today to check on your cardiovascular status and see if we need to adjust your treatment plan. Let's start by checking your blood pressure and heart rate. Please roll up your sleeve for me.\n[patient] Sure thing.\n[doctor] (After checking) Your blood pressure and heart rate are within normal limits right now, which is good. Now I'm going to listen to your heart. Please breathe normally for me.\n[patient] Okay.\n[doctor] (After listening) Your heart sounds are regular, and I don't hear any murmurs or abnormal rhythms. Let's move on to your lung exam. Take deep breaths in and out for me, please.\n[patient] (Breathes deeply)\n[doctor] Your lungs sound clear, no wheezing or crackles. Next, I'd like to palpate your abdomen. Let me know if you feel any discomfort.\n[patient] (During examination) It feels alright, no pain.\n[doctor] Good, your abdomen is soft and non-tender. I'm not feeling any masses or enlargement of your liver or spleen. Now, I'd like to check your extremities for any swelling or changes in circulation. Could you lay back for me?\n[patient] (Lies back)\n[doctor] (After examining) No signs of edema, and your pulses are strong in all extremities. Everything looks good from a physical standpoint. However, given the recurring nature of your chest pain, I want to order some tests to get more information. We'll start with an EKG to look at your heart's electrical activity, and I'd also like to get some blood work done, including a lipid panel and cardiac enzymes. How does that sound to you?\n[patient] That sounds like a good plan. I just want to make sure everything is okay.\n[doctor] Absolutely, and I'm here to ensure we do just that. After we have the results from these tests, we may consider further investigations like a stress test or even an angiogram if needed. But let's not get ahead of ourselves. Do you have any questions or concerns about the tests or anything else?\n[patient] I'm just wondering if there's anything else I should be doing at home to help with the chest pain or to prevent it.\n[doctor] It's crucial to continue with the lifestyle modifications we've discussed\u2014eating a balanced diet, exercising regularly, and avoiding triggers like heavy lifting or strenuous activity. If the chest discomfort occurs, use your Nitroglycerin as prescribed, and if the pain doesn't resolve or worsens, seek immediate medical attention. Additionally, managing stress can also play a role in controlling angina symptoms.\n[patient] Okay, I'll keep all of that in mind. I do try to manage stress, but it's not always easy.\n[doctor] I understand, Sofia. Managing stress can be challenging, but techniques like deep breathing, meditation, or even counseling can be very beneficial. Now, do you have any other questions for me today?\n[patient] No, I think that covers everything. Thank you for being so thorough.\n[doctor] You're welcome. It's important that we stay proactive about your health. We'll schedule a follow-up appointment to review the test results and discuss the next steps. In the meantime, please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns or if your symptoms change. Take care, Sofia, and we'll see you soon.\n[patient] Thank you, doctor. I appreciate your help. See you soon.",

did you wake up with it ?\n[patient] no . it just it randomly . i tolerated it for four days but then had to go to the emergency room because nothing i did relieved it . they did a bunch of testing and did n't find anything .\n[doctor] okay . can you point to the area of your chest where the pain was located ?\n[patient] well , it was here in the center of my chest , right behind my breastbone . it felt like i was having a heart attack . the pain was really sharp .\n[doctor] did they prescribe you any medications in the er ?\n[patient] no . they ran an ekg and did blood tests , but like i said , everything was normal .\n[doctor] okay . i see .\n[patient] they thought it was something to do with the gi system , so that's why they referred me here .\n[doctor] interesting . uh , do you remember having any heartburn or indigestion at , at the time ?\n[patient] uh , maybe . i do n't think i've ever had heartburn , so i'm not sure what that feels like .\n[doctor] was the pain worse with eating or exercise ?\n[patient] yes . with eating .\n[doctor] okay . any difficulty swallowing ?\n[patient] mm-hmm . i did .\n[doctor] okay . and that's also resolved since the initial episode three months ago ?\n[patient] yes . thankfully . the chest pain and swallowing problem got better about three days after i went to the er . but i just feel like there's something wrong .\n[doctor] okay . so how has your weight been .\n[patient] i've been trying to lose weight .\n[doctor] that's good . any in- ... issues with abdominal pain ?\n[patient] uh , no .\n[doctor] okay . good . and how about your bowel movements ; are they okay ?\n[patient] they're normal .\n[doctor] all right . are you aware of any family history of gi problems ?\n[patient] i do n't think so .\n[doctor] have had you had any surgeries on your abdomen , or gall bladder , or appendix ?\n[patient] yes . they took my gall bladder out several years ago .\n[doctor] okay . if you wan na lay down here on the table for me and lets take a look at you .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] so when i push on your lower belly , do you have any pain , or does it feel tender ?\n[patient] no .\n[doctor] okay . how about up here in your upper abdomen ?\n[patient] yes . it , it hurts a little .\n[doctor] okay . and even when i press lightly like this ?\n[patient] yes . uh , just a little uncomfortable .\n[doctor] okay . does it hurt more when i press over here on the left or over here on the right ? or is it about the same ?\n[patient] i'd say it's about the same .\n[doctor] okay . so we'll say you have some mild tenderness to light palpation in the upper abdominal quadrants , but everything on your exam looks normal and looks good .\n[patient] okay . good .\n[doctor] so let's talk about your symptoms real quick . obviously , with the chest discomfort , we worry about heart issues , but i'm reassured that those were ruled out with all the testing they did in the er . um , other potential causes could be anxiety , esophagitis , which is irritation of the esophagus . but typically with these , um ... but typically , these cause the pain that would last for a long time rather than that isolated incident like you had . um , it's also possible that you had intense heartburn for a few days .\n[patient] well , since you mention anxiety , i was going through a really stressful job transition right around the time this happened .\n[doctor] okay . that's good to know . so stress from this could be , um ... could be , uh ... could be very well have contributed to your condition .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] so we could do an , uh , egd or upper endoscopy to take a look at your esophagus and stomach . this would allow us to look for esophagitis . but your symptoms occurred three months ago and you have n't had any additional episodes , so likely if it were esophagitis , it's already healed by the point ... by this point , and we would n't be able to see anything . the other option is just to continue to monitor , uh , for any additional symptoms at which point we could do the egd . uh , with you being asymptomatic for so long right now , i'm comfortable with that option . but what do you think ?\n[patient] i'd like to hold off on the egd and wait to see if i have more symptoms .\n[doctor] that sounds good . um , so you can call the office if you have any additional episodes of pain or any other symptoms you're concerned about . if that happens , we'll get you scheduled for an egd to take a look . if not , you can follow up with me ... follow up with me as needed for any other gi complaints .\n[patient] okay .\n[doctor] all right ?

    "transcript": "[doctor] Good afternoon, Amelia. How have you been feeling since your last appointment?\n[patient] Hi, Dr. Martin. Honestly, it's been a bit rough. I've been dealing with some side effects, I think.\n[doctor] I see. Before we dive into that, I just want to confirm your date of birth for our records. It's 8/14/1975, correct?\n[patient] Yes, that's right.\n[doctor] Great. Now, you mentioned side effects. Can you tell me more about what you're experiencing?\n[patient] Well, I've been feeling really tired all the time, and I've had some stomach issues, too.\n[doctor] I understand that can be quite uncomfortable. Are you still taking Lamotrigine and Valproate as prescribed?\n[patient] Yes, I take 100 mg of Lamotrigine in the morning and 100 mg at night. For the Valproate, it's 250 mg twice a day.\n[doctor] Those are standard doses, but side effects can occur. It's important to monitor them closely. Have you noticed any changes in your mood or seizure control with these medications?\n[patient] My mood has been pretty stable, which is good. And I haven't had any seizures since we adjusted the dose last time.\n[doctor] That's excellent news concerning your seizure control and mood stability. It's possible that the fatigue and stomach issues could be related to the Valproate. Let's discuss your overall health a bit more. How has your appetite been?\n[patient] It's been okay, I guess. I don't have much of an appetite in the morning, but it gets better throughout the day.\n[doctor] Alright. And how about your sleep? Are you resting well at night?\n[patient] Not really. I've been having trouble falling asleep, and I wake up a few times during the night.\n[doctor] Sleep disturbances can contribute to feeling fatigued. Have you been experiencing any stress or anxiety that might affect your sleep?\n[patient] I have been more stressed at work lately. We've got a big project due soon, and it's been taking up a lot of my time and energy.\n[doctor] Stress can certainly impact both your sleep and gastrointestinal system. It's important to find ways to manage that. Do you currently have any strategies in place for dealing with stress?\n[patient] I try to take short walks during my breaks at work, and I've been doing some deep breathing exercises when I feel overwhelmed.\n[doctor] Those are great strategies. Regular physical activity and relaxation techniques can make a significant difference. Now, regarding your stomach issues, can you describe them a bit more for me?\n[patient] Sure. I've been experiencing some nausea, especially in the mornings, and I've had a few episodes of vomiting after taking my medication.\n[doctor] Nausea and vomiting are not uncommon side effects. It might help to take your medication with food if you're not already doing so. Have you noticed any specific foods that trigger these symptoms, or is it more random?\n[patient] It seems to happen regardless of what I eat. I've tried taking the medication with different types of food, but it doesn't seem to make much of a difference.\n[doctor] I see. We may need to look into adjusting your medication or trying an alternative if these side effects persist. Are you currently taking any other medications or supplements?\n[patient] No, just the Lamotrigine and Valproate.\n[doctor] Good to know. Let's do a quick physical examination to check for any other possible issues. I'll need you to sit up here on the examination table, please.\n[patient] Okay, no problem.\n[doctor] I'm going to start by checking your vital signs. [The doctor takes the patient's blood pressure, pulse, and temperature.] Your blood pressure and pulse are within normal ranges, and no fever, which is good. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs now. Please breathe normally for me.\n[patient] [Breathes normally while the doctor listens with a stethoscope.]\n[doctor] Heart and lung sounds are clear. Now, I'm going to palpate your abdomen. Let me know if you feel any discomfort or pain, Amelia.\n[patient] Will do.\n[doctor] [The doctor gently palpates the patient's abdomen.] Any tenderness here?\n[patient] A little when you press on the upper part, but it's not too bad.\n[doctor] Alright, that could be related to the stomach issues you've been describing. I don't feel any abnormalities, though, which is reassuring. You can lie back down now. Have you had any headaches or visual disturbances lately?\n[patient] I've had a couple of mild headaches, but nothing severe. No problems with my vision.\n[doctor] Good to hear. It's important to keep track of headaches, as they can be related to your condition or medication. Now, let's discuss your treatment options. Given the side effects you're experiencing, we could consider reducing the dosage of Valproate and monitoring how you respond. This might help alleviate the stomach problems and fatigue.\n[patient] That sounds like a good plan. I'm willing to try that if you think it could help.\n[doctor] I do believe it's worth a try, but we'll need to keep a close eye on your seizure activity and mood. I'll also give you a prescription for a medication to help with the nausea. It's important to manage that so you can maintain your appetite and nutrition.\n[patient] I appreciate that, Dr. Martin. I hope it helps.\n[doctor] I hope so, too. We'll schedule a follow-up appointment in four weeks to assess how you're doing with the dosage change and the new medication. If you experience any worsening of your symptoms or if you have a seizure, please contact the office immediately or go to the emergency room.\n[patient] Will do. Thank you for your help today.\n[doctor] You're very welcome, Amelia. Before you go, do you have any questions or concerns about the changes we're making or anything else?\n[patient] No, I think you've covered everything. I just want to feel better, and I'm glad we have a plan.\n[doctor] Great. I'll have the nurse come in with the new prescription and to help schedule your next appointment. Take care of yourself, Amelia, and don't hesitate to reach out if you need anything.\n[patient] Thanks, Dr. Martin. See you in a few weeks.\n[doctor] See you then. Have a good day.\n[patient] You too, goodbye.\n\n[The doctor makes notes in the patient's medical record summarizing the visit, including Amelia Hernandez's ongoing medication regimen with Lamotrigine (100 mg twice daily) and Valproate (250 mg twice daily), the side effects experienced, and the plan to reduce Valproate dosage and add an anti-nausea medication. The doctor also notes to monitor for changes in seizure activity and mood, with a follow-up appointment scheduled in four weeks.]",

    "transcript": "[doctor] Good morning, Liam. How have you been since our last visit?\n\n[patient] Morning, Doc. I've been okay, just managing, you know.\n\n[doctor] I see. Are you still taking Enalapril and Furosemide as previously prescribed?\n\n[patient] Yes, I'm on Enalapril 10 mg once daily and Furosemide 40 mg every morning.\n\n[doctor] Excellent, and how are you feeling on those medications?\n\n[patient] Well, the Enalapril seems to be okay, but the Furosemide makes me go to the bathroom a lot. It's a bit inconvenient at times, but I\u2019m managing.\n\n[doctor] That's a common side effect, unfortunately. But it's important to manage your fluid levels. Now, tell me, have there been any changes in your symptoms or anything new that's been bothering you?\n\n[patient] Actually, I've been feeling a bit dizzy lately. It usually happens when I stand up too quickly.\n\n[doctor] Dizziness, you say? That could be related to your blood pressure or perhaps dehydration from the Furosemide. We'll need to keep an eye on that. Have you noticed any swelling in your legs or ankles?\n\n[patient] Not really, no more than usual.\n\n[doctor] Alright, that's good. Any shortness of breath or chest pain?\n\n[patient] No chest pain, but I do get winded more easily these days when I take the stairs.\n\n[doctor] Okay, we'll check your heart and lungs today to make sure everything is functioning properly. How about your diet and fluid intake? Are you following the recommendations we discussed?\n\n[patient] Yeah, I've cut down on salt like you said, and I\u2019m trying to drink enough water, but not too much.\n\n[doctor] Good, that's important with your medication regimen. How about any over-the-counter medicines or supplements? Have you started anything new?\n\n[patient] No, I haven't started anything new.\n\n[doctor] Now, Liam, I want to make sure we're monitoring your kidney function closely since you're on Furosemide. How has your urine output been?\n\n[patient] I would say it's pretty normal, just frequent because of the diuretic.\n\n[doctor] Okay, that's expected. We'll do some lab work today to check your electrolytes and kidney function. Now, let's move on to a physical examination. Please remove your shirt, and I'll listen to your heart and lungs first.\n\n[patient] Sure thing.\n\n[doctor] Your heart rate is regular, and there are no abnormal sounds. Now deep breaths for me, please... Lungs are clear, that's good. Let's check your blood pressure now.\n\n[patient] Alright.\n\n[doctor] Blood pressure is a little on the low side, which might explain the dizziness. We'll need to be cautious with that. Now, I'm going to check for any fluid retention in your legs. Please lie down on the exam table.\n\n[patient] Okay, done.\n\n[doctor] There's a slight pitting edema, but it's minimal. I'm going to press on your abdomen now, tell me if you feel any discomfort.\n\n[patient] No, it feels fine.\n\n[doctor] Great. Now please sit up. I'm going to check your reflexes and the strength in your legs.\n\n[patient] Sure.\n\n[doctor] Reflexes are normal, and strength is good. Can you stand for me? I want to see if the dizziness is provoked by changes in position.\n\n[patient] Yeah, I can do that. Just a bit... whoa, a little light-headed there.\n\n[doctor] Okay, take your time. It's important we monitor this. I'm going to recommend some adjustments. Let's sit back down and discuss the plan.\n\n[patient] Alright, sitting down.\n\n[doctor] Based on today's exam and your report of dizziness, we may need to adjust your Furosemide dose or perhaps try an alternative. I also want to ensure that the Enalapril dose is still appropriate for you. We'll start with some blood work to check your renal function and electrolytes, given your current medication.\n\n[patient] Sounds good. When will I know the results?\n\n[doctor] The results should be back within a few days, and my office will call you to go over them. Depending on the findings, we might need to tweak your medication regimen a bit.\n\n[patient] Okay, I understand.\n\n[doctor] Additionally, I want you to monitor your blood pressure at home. Do it twice a day, once in the morning and once in the evening. Write down the readings and bring them with you at your next appointment.\n\n[patient] Will do.\n\n[doctor] And Liam, I'm going to prescribe a lower dose of Furosemide for now. We'll try 20 mg in the morning and see if that reduces the dizziness without compromising the management of your fluid retention.\n\n[patient] Sounds like a plan.\n\n[doctor] Also, try to stand up slowly from sitting or lying down to help with the dizziness. It's a simple trick that can make a big difference.\n\n[patient] I'll keep that in mind.\n\n[doctor] Good. Now, any other concerns or questions for me today?\n\n[patient] No, I think that covers everything.\n\n[doctor] Alright then. I'll send the prescription to your pharmacy, and don't forget to schedule your follow-up appointment after we've reviewed your lab results.\n\n[patient] Got it, thank you.\n\n[doctor] You're welcome, Liam. Take care, and don't hesitate to reach out if anything changes or if you have any concerns before your next visit.\n\n[patient] I appreciate it, Doctor.\n\n[doctor] Have a good day, Liam. We'll be in touch soon.",

patient .\n[doctor] hello , ms. brown .\n[patient] hi . yes , that's me .\n[doctor] wonderful . i'm doctor stewart . it's lovely to meet you .\n[patient] you as well .\n[doctor] so , you've come to see me today because you had a right breast lumpectomy last year . is that right ?\n[patient] yes . on january 20th , 2020 .\n[doctor] okay . and how have you been since then ? any problems or concerns ?\n[patient] no , i'm feeling good . i do my self breast exams religiously now and have n't felt anything since .\n[doctor] perfect . i want to back up and go over your history so i can make sure everything in your chart is correct and i do n't miss anything . so , i'll tell you what we have in your chart from your other providers and you tell me if anything is wrong or missing . sound good ?\n[patient] sounds good .\n[doctor] great . so , i have that you were found to have a calcification in your right breast during a mammogram in october 2019 . was that just a normal screening mammogram , or was it done because you felt a lump ?\n[patient] it was just a normal one you're supposed to get every so often .\n[doctor] i see . and then it looks like you had an ultrasound of your right breast on november 3rd , 2019 , which revealed a mass at the two o'clock position , 11 centimeters from the nipple in the retroareolar region . the report states the mass was point four by two by three centimeters .\n[patient] yes , that sounds right . hard to remember now , though .\n[doctor] yep , definitely .\n[doctor] based on those results , they decided to do an ultrasound-guided core needle biopsy on december 5th , 2019 . pathology results during that biopsy came back as grade two , er positive , pr positive , dcis , or ductal carcinoma in situ .\n[patient] yes . unfortunately .\n[doctor] i know . scary stuff . but you had a lumpectomy on january 20th , 2020 , which removed the eight millimeter tumor and margins were negative . the pathology confirmed dcis . looks like they also removed 5 lymph nodes , which , thankfully , were negative for malignancy . that's great !\n[patient] yeah , i was definitely very relieved .\n[doctor] and your last mammogram was in january 2021 ? and that was normal .\n[patient] yes .\n[doctor] okay . so , i feel like i have a good grasp of what's been going on with you now . and you're here today to establish care with me so i can continue to follow you and make sure you're doing well , right ?\n[patient] yes . fingers crossed .\n[doctor] definitely . we'll keep a close eye on you and take good care of you .\n[patient] okay , sounds good .\n[doctor] i have a few more questions for you . when was your last colonoscopy ?\n[patient] i had one in 2018 and , if i remember correctly , i had one polyp and that was removed and it was n't cancerous .\n[doctor] okay , yes , i see that report now . one polyp in the sigmoid colon which had a benign tubular adenoma . okay . and when was your last menstrual period ?\n[patient] gosh . it was probably around 30 years ago .\n[doctor] okay . do you have children ?\n[patient] i do . i have five .\n[doctor] ah , big family then . that's nice .\n[patient] yes . and they're all having kids of their own now , so it's getting even bigger .\n[doctor] i bet . sounds like fun .\n[patient] it is .\n[doctor] did you have any other pregnancies that were miscarriages or terminations ?\n[patient] really , i did not .\n[doctor] okay . so for the record , that's g5 p5 . and now that you're post-menopausal , are you currently or have you ever been on hormone replacement therapy ?\n[patient] my primary care doctor gave me the option years ago but i decided against it .\n[doctor] okay . and on your review systems form , you indicated that you've not had any recent weight loss or gain , headaches , bone pain , urinary symptoms , or blood in the stools . but you did indicate that you have some back pain , joint pain , and high cholesterol . tell me some more about those .\n[patient] okay . so i've seen doctors for all of those . they've said , excuse me , the back and knee pain are age-related . and the cholesterol is a fairly new diagnosis , but i am working on exercise and cutting back on fatty foods to see if i can get it lower without any medication .\n[doctor] okay . and your primary care doctor is following you for that , right ?\n[patient] that's correct .\n[doctor] okay . for medications , i have that you take coq10 , vitamin d , vitamin c , fish oil , and elderberry fruit . is that all right ?\n[patient] yes , and that's all .\n[doctor] okay . so for your medical history , it's high cholesterol and stage 0 er/pr positive invasive ductal carcinoma of the right breast . any surgeries other than the lumpectomy ?\n[patient] i did have my tubes tied after my last baby , but that's all .\n[doctor] okay . and how about family history ?\n[patient] my mom had non-hodgkin's lymphoma and my dad had prostate cancer and heart disease , but i think

    "transcript": "[doctor] Good morning, Nathan Stewart. I see here your date of birth is 8/12/1978. Today's visit is a follow-up for your type 1 diabetes management, correct?\n[patient] Yes, that's right, Doctor.\n\n[doctor] Great. I'm Dr. Ellis. Before we proceed, how have you been feeling overall since our last visit?\n[patient] Well, I've been managing, but it's always a bit of a daily challenge, you know?\n\n[doctor] Understandable. Managing diabetes is indeed a lifelong commitment. Let's start by reviewing your current medication regimen. According to your chart, you're on Insulin Aspart with a sliding scale before meals and Insulin Glargine, 20 units at bedtime. Is that still accurate?\n[patient] Yes, that's what I've been taking.\n\n[doctor] Excellent. Have you had any issues with hypoglycemia or high blood sugar readings since our last appointment?\n[patient] I've had a couple of lows. They usually happen if I've been more active than usual or if I miss a snack.\n\n[doctor] I see. It's essential to adjust your carbohydrate intake during those times of increased activity. Make sure you always carry some fast-acting carbs with you. Now, have you noticed any patterns to your high readings?\n[patient] Sometimes after meals. I think I may not be counting carbs as accurately as I should.\n\n[doctor] Carb counting can be tricky but it's key for your insulin dosing. We can go over some strategies to improve that today. How about your insulin administration technique \u2013 any issues there?\n[patient] No, I feel pretty comfortable with that. I rotate the injection sites like you showed me.\n\n[doctor] Good to hear. Rotating sites helps prevent lipodystrophy. Now, let's talk about your blood glucose monitoring. How often are you checking your levels?\n[patient] I check it before meals and at bedtime, so four times a day.\n\n[doctor] That's good. Regular monitoring is crucial. And how about your insulin pump \u2013 have you considered using one?\n[patient] I have thought about it, but I'm not sure. It's a big change.\n\n[doctor] It can be a big adjustment, but it might provide you with more flexibility and potentially better control. We can discuss this in more detail later. Now, have you had any recent hospitalizations or visited the emergency room for anything diabetes-related?\n[patient] No, thankfully, I haven't.\n\n[doctor] That's great to hear. Now, aside from the lows you mentioned, any other complications like vision changes, numbness, or tingling in your feet?\n[patient] I haven't noticed anything like that.\n\n[doctor] Excellent. We'll still do a comprehensive check today. Let's see... It looks like your last HbA1c was three months ago and it was 7.2%. We'd like to keep it below 7%, so we'll need to check it again today. What about your diet and exercise routine? Any changes there?\n[patient] I've been trying to walk more, aiming for about 30 minutes a day. Diet-wise, I'm following the plan we talked about last time.\n\n[doctor] That's good, Nathan. Exercise is beneficial for insulin sensitivity. Keep up with the walking and perhaps we can gradually introduce more variety into your routine. Regarding your diet, consistency is key, especially with meal times and carbohydrate intake. Now, are you experiencing any issues with your insulin supply or equipment?\n[patient] No, my prescriptions are being filled regularly, and I've got enough supplies.\n\n[doctor] Good. It's important to have an adequate stock, especially of your insulins. Now, let's move on to some other health maintenance topics. When was your last eye exam?\n[patient] About six months ago. They said everything looked stable.\n\n[doctor] That's crucial for diabetes. We want to catch any retinopathy early. And dental exams? Gum disease can affect blood sugar control.\n[patient] I saw my dentist three months ago. No problems there.\n\n[doctor] Excellent. Now, let's discuss your support system. Managing diabetes can be overwhelming at times. Do you feel like you have adequate support at home?\n[patient] My family's very supportive, and I've joined a diabetes support group online which has been helpful.\n\n[doctor] Support groups can be a valuable resource. It's good to have a community that understands what you're going through. Let's also talk about your mental health. Diabetes can take a toll on your emotional well-being. Have you been feeling stressed, anxious, or depressed?\n[patient] Some days are better than others, but I think I'm handling it okay.\n\n[doctor] If you ever feel overwhelmed, don't hesitate to reach out. We can provide resources for counseling or therapy if needed. Now, how about your blood pressure and cholesterol levels? Those are important to manage alongside your diabetes.\n[patient] Last I checked, my blood pressure was fine. I'm not sure about my cholesterol levels, though.\n\n[doctor] We'll check both today. Managing cardiovascular risk factors is key. Now, have you had any vaccines recently, like the flu shot or the COVID-19 vaccine?\n[patient] I got the flu shot last fall and the COVID-19 booster a couple of months ago.\n\n[doctor] Excellent. Staying up-to-date with vaccinations is very important. Now let's transition to the physical exam. I'll start with your vitals and then we'll do a comprehensive check, including your feet for any neuropathy or circulation issues.\n[patient] Sounds good, Doctor.\n\n[doctor] After the exam, I want to go over your insulin dosages again and make sure we're optimizing your regimen. We may need to tweak your Insulin Aspart sliding scale or discuss the possibility of an insulin pump, as mentioned earlier.\n[patient] Okay, I'm open to whatever will help me manage better.\n\n[doctor] Great attitude, Nathan. Following the exam, we'll also draw some blood for your HbA1c, lipid panel, and kidney function tests. It's important we keep track of all these aspects of your health.\n[patient] I understand. It's a lot, but I know it's necessary.\n\n[doctor] You're doing an excellent job managing a complex condition. Now, please, hop up on the exam table, and let's get started. We'll review everything in detail after the exam and make a plan for your ongoing care.\n[patient] Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate the help.\n\n[doctor] Of course, Nathan. It's what we're here for. Let's get you checked out, and then we'll continue our discussion on the next steps for your diabetes management plan.\n[patient] Alright, let's do this.\n\n[doctor] Remember, Nathan, it's all about teamwork. You're not in this alone, and we'll work together to keep you healthy and manage your diabetes effectively. After the exam, we\u2019ll also discuss any additional screenings or referrals that might be beneficial for you.\n[patient] That sounds good. Thanks for your support, Doctor Ellis.\n\n[doctor] You're welcome, Nathan. Now, let's proceed with the exam.",

patient .\n[doctor] hello , ms. brown .\n[patient] hi . yes , that's me .\n[doctor] wonderful . i'm doctor stewart . it's lovely to meet you .\n[patient] you as well .\n[doctor] so , you've come to see me today because you had a right breast lumpectomy last year . is that right ?\n[patient] yes . on january 20th , 2020 .\n[doctor] okay . and how have you been since then ? any problems or concerns ?\n[patient] no , i'm feeling good . i do my self breast exams religiously now and have n't felt anything since .\n[doctor] perfect . i want to back up and go over your history so i can make sure everything in your chart is correct and i do n't miss anything . so , i'll tell you what we have in your chart from your other providers and you tell me if anything is wrong or missing . sound good ?\n[patient] sounds good .\n[doctor] great . so , i have that you were found to have a calcification in your right breast during a mammogram in october 2019 . was that just a normal screening mammogram , or was it done because you felt a lump ?\n[patient] it was just a normal one you're supposed to get every so often .\n[doctor] i see . and then it looks like you had an ultrasound of your right breast on november 3rd , 2019 , which revealed a mass at the two o'clock position , 11 centimeters from the nipple in the retroareolar region . the report states the mass was point four by two by three centimeters .\n[patient] yes , that sounds right . hard to remember now , though .\n[doctor] yep , definitely .\n[doctor] based on those results , they decided to do an ultrasound-guided core needle biopsy on december 5th , 2019 . pathology results during that biopsy came back as grade two , er positive , pr positive , dcis , or ductal carcinoma in situ .\n[patient] yes . unfortunately .\n[doctor] i know . scary stuff . but you had a lumpectomy on january 20th , 2020 , which removed the eight millimeter tumor and margins were negative . the pathology confirmed dcis . looks like they also removed 5 lymph nodes , which , thankfully , were negative for malignancy . that's great !\n[patient] yeah , i was definitely very relieved .\n[doctor] and your last mammogram was in january 2021 ? and that was normal .\n[patient] yes .\n[doctor] okay . so , i feel like i have a good grasp of what's been going on with you now . and you're here today to establish care with me so i can continue to follow you and make sure you're doing well , right ?\n[patient] yes . fingers crossed .\n[doctor] definitely . we'll keep a close eye on you and take good care of you .\n[patient] okay , sounds good .\n[doctor] i have a few more questions for you . when was your last colonoscopy ?\n[patient] i had one in 2018 and , if i remember correctly , i had one polyp and that was removed and it was n't cancerous .\n[doctor] okay , yes , i see that report now . one polyp in the sigmoid colon which had a benign tubular adenoma . okay . and when was your last menstrual period ?\n[patient] gosh . it was probably around 30 years ago .\n[doctor] okay . do you have children ?\n[patient] i do . i have five .\n[doctor] ah , big family then . that's nice .\n[patient] yes . and they're all having kids of their own now , so it's getting even bigger .\n[doctor] i bet . sounds like fun .\n[patient] it is .\n[doctor] did you have any other pregnancies that were miscarriages or terminations ?\n[patient] really , i did not .\n[doctor] okay . so for the record , that's g5 p5 . and now that you're post-menopausal , are you currently or have you ever been on hormone replacement therapy ?\n[patient] my primary care doctor gave me the option years ago but i decided against it .\n[doctor] okay . and on your review systems form , you indicated that you've not had any recent weight loss or gain , headaches , bone pain , urinary symptoms , or blood in the stools . but you did indicate that you have some back pain , joint pain , and high cholesterol . tell me some more about those .\n[patient] okay . so i've seen doctors for all of those . they've said , excuse me , the back and knee pain are age-related . and the cholesterol is a fairly new diagnosis , but i am working on exercise and cutting back on fatty foods to see if i can get it lower without any medication .\n[doctor] okay . and your primary care doctor is following you for that , right ?\n[patient] that's correct .\n[doctor] okay . for medications , i have that you take coq10 , vitamin d , vitamin c , fish oil , and elderberry fruit . is that all right ?\n[patient] yes , and that's all .\n[doctor] okay . so for your medical history , it's high cholesterol and stage 0 er/pr positive invasive ductal carcinoma of the right breast . any surgeries other than the lumpectomy ?\n[patient] i did have my tubes tied after my last baby , but that's all .\n[doctor] okay . and how about family history ?\n[patient] my mom had non-hodgkin's lymphoma and my dad had prostate cancer and heart disease , but i think that's it .\n[doctor] all right . any family history of breast cancer ?\n[patient] none .\n[doctor] did any of your children have medical issues or siblings with medical problems ?\n[patient] i do not have any siblings and , thankfully , my children are all healthy .\n[doctor] wonderful . do you have any history of smoking , illicit drug use , heavy alcohol consumption ?\n[patient] no drugs . i do

    "transcript": "[Doctor] Good morning, Noah Patel. It\u2019s nice to see you again. How have you been since our last visit?\n\n[Patient] Good morning, Doctor. I've been managing alright, thanks.\n\n[Doctor] I'm glad to hear that. Your file here says your date of birth is 6/12/1981, correct?\n\n[Patient] Yes, that's right.\n\n[Doctor] Great. Well, the purpose of today\u2019s visit is to follow up on your diabetes management and to discuss any other health concerns you may have. Before we dive in, I just want to confirm the medications you're on. Currently, you are taking Metformin, correct?\n\n[Patient] Yes, I'm on Metformin, 500 mg twice daily.\n\n[Doctor] Excellent. And how has that been going? Any issues with the medication, like gastrointestinal side effects or hypoglycemia?\n\n[Patient] No serious issues. I did have some stomach upset when I first started, but it's settled now.\n\n[Doctor] That's good to hear. It's common for patients to experience some stomach issues with Metformin initially. Are you keeping up with your blood glucose monitoring?\n\n[Patient] Yes, I check my blood sugar levels every morning and evening. The readings have been fairly stable.\n\n[Doctor] Consistency is key in managing diabetes. Now, let's review your diet and exercise. Have you been able to maintain a balanced diet and regular physical activity?\n\n[Patient] I've been trying, Doctor. I've cut down on sugary foods and increased my vegetable intake. For exercise, I walk at least 30 minutes a day.\n\n[Doctor] Those are excellent habits, Noah. Keep it up! Now, do you have any new health concerns today that you'd like to discuss?\n\n[Patient] Not really new concerns, but I've been feeling a bit more fatigued lately. I'm not sure if it's related to my diabetes or something else.\n\n[Doctor] Fatigue can be caused by many factors, including diabetes, but let's not make assumptions. I'll make a note to run some tests to check your thyroid function and vitamin levels. It could be anemia or something else we need to address.\n\n[Patient] That would be great, Doctor. I just want to make sure everything's okay.\n\n[Doctor] Absolutely, we\u2019ll cover all bases. Now, regarding your diabetes management, are you familiar with the potential complications, such as neuropathy, retinopathy, and kidney issues?\n\n[Patient] I've heard of them, but I'm not too familiar with the details.\n\n[Doctor] That\u2019s fine, Noah. Let's go over them briefly. Neuropathy is nerve damage that can cause tingling or numbness, usually in the hands or feet. Retinopathy affects the eyes and can lead to vision problems if not monitored closely. And of course, diabetes can affect kidney function over time, which is why we run regular blood tests to monitor your kidney health.\n\n[Patient] I see. Are there any symptoms I should watch out for?\n\n[Doctor] Yes, for neuropathy, be alert for any sensation changes in your extremities. For your eyes, make sure you\u2019re getting them checked annually by an ophthalmologist. And with kidney health, it's more about the lab results than symptoms, which is why those checks are so important.\n\n[Patient] Got it. I'll make sure to keep an eye on those things.\n\n[Doctor] Good. Now, let's update your health record. Any hospitalizations or surgeries since your last visit?\n\n[Patient] No, nothing like that.\n\n[Doctor] How about any changes in your family medical history? Any new diagnoses for close relatives that you've become aware of?\n\n[Patient] Well, my father was recently diagnosed with hypertension.\n\n[Doctor] I\u2019ll note that. It\u2019s important to monitor your blood pressure regularly as well, given the family history. Speaking of which, let's check your blood pressure now.\n\n[Patient] Sure, go ahead.\n\n[Doctor] [After checking blood pressure] Your blood pressure looks good. Now, I'd like to do a physical examination, check your feet for any signs of neuropathy, and listen to your heart and lungs. Are you experiencing any pain or discomfort anywhere?\n\n[Patient] No, I'm not in any pain right now.\n\n[Doctor] Good to know. [After examination] Everything appears to be normal upon physical examination. Your feet are looking good, no signs of neuropathy, and your heart and lungs sound clear. Next, let\u2019s discuss your mental health. How have you been feeling emotionally?\n\n[Patient] I've been a bit stressed with work, and I guess the fatigue doesn't help. But overall, I'm managing.\n\n[Doctor] Stress can certainly impact your blood sugar levels and overall health. Have you considered any stress-reduction techniques or perhaps speaking with a mental health professional?\n\n[Patient] I haven't really, but it might be a good idea.\n\n[Doctor] I'd recommend it. It's important to take care of your mental health just as much as your physical health. Now, let's talk about your next steps. I'd like you to continue your current dose of Metformin. Additionally, we should schedule an HbA1c test to get a better picture of your blood sugar control over the past 3 months.\n\n[Patient] Okay, when should I get that test done?\n\n[Doctor] Ideally, within the next week or so. The results will help us determine if we need to adjust your treatment plan. Also, you mentioned fatigue\u2014let's get those thyroid and vitamin tests I suggested earlier.\n\n[Patient] That makes sense. I'll make sure to schedule those tests.\n\n[Doctor] Excellent. And regarding your lifestyle, continue your healthy eating and daily walking. These are crucial for managing your diabetes.\n\n[Patient] Will do, Doctor.\n\n[Doctor] Great. Now, do you have any questions or concerns that we haven\u2019t addressed yet?\n\n[Patient] Not at the moment, no. You've been very thorough.\n\n[Doctor] I'm glad to hear that. Before you go, let's schedule your next appointment. We should meet again in three months to review your lab results and check your progress. How does that sound?\n\n[Patient] Sounds good to me. I'll set that up with the receptionist on my way out.\n\n[Doctor] Perfect. And remember, if anything comes up or if you have questions, don't hesitate to give us a call. It's important to stay proactive about your health.\n\n[Patient] Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your help.\n\n[Doctor] You're welcome, Noah. Take care, and I'll see you at your next appointment. My nurse will come in shortly to provide you with the lab forms and help you with any other discharge instructions.\n\n[Patient] Thanks. Have a good day, Doctor.\n\n[Doctor] You too, Noah.

    "example_transcript": "[doctor] hey jean how're you doing today\n[patient] i'm doing alright aside from this foot pain that i have\n[doctor] so i see here that you looks like you hurt your left foot here where you were playing soccer can you tell me a little bit more about what happened\n[patient] yeah so yeah i was playing in a soccer game yesterday and i was trying to steal the ball from another player and she ended up falling directly onto my right foot and i do n't know i i mean i was trying to get around her and my body ended up twisting around her and then i accidentally felt a pain in my foot\n[doctor] okay so have you ever hurt your left foot before\n[patient] no i've had a lot of injuries in soccer but never injured this foot\n[doctor] okay and then so after the fall and the entanglement with the other player were you able to continue playing\n[patient] no i had to stop playing right away and actually being helped off the field\n[doctor] wow okay and what have you been doing for the the pain since then\n[patient] so i've been keeping it elevated icing it the trainer wrapped it yesterday and taking ibuprofen as well\n[doctor] okay alright so without any ibuprofen can you tell me what your pain level is\n[patient] without ibuprofen i would say my pain is a three\n[doctor] okay and then with your ibuprofen can you tell me what your pain level is\n[patient] like a seven eight\n[doctor] okay so how long have you been playing soccer\n[patient] really since i was like four five i've been playing a long time\n[doctor] well that's cool yeah we our our youngest daughter she is almost sixteen and she plays the inner marrial soccer league they are down at the rex center did is that where you started playing or did you guys did you start playing somewhere else\n[patient] yeah just like this local town leak i started playing that way and then played all throughout school\n[doctor] that's\n[patient] high school teams\n[doctor] that's awesome so just out of curiosity with the left foot have you experienced anything like numbness or tingling or or any strange sensation\n[patient] no i have not\n[doctor] okay now if it's okay with you i would like to do a quick physical exam i reviewed your vitals and everything looks good blood pressure was one eighteen over seventy two heart rate was fifty eight respiratory rate was fourteen you are afebrile and you had an o2 saturation of ninety nine percent on room air on your heart exam your regular of rate and rhythm do n't appreciate any clicks rubs or murmurs no ectopic beats noted there on auscultation listening to your lungs lungs are clear and equal bilaterally so you're moving good air i'd like to do a focused foot exam on your left foot so i do see some bruising on the bottom of your foot and on the top of your foot as well now there is associated swelling and i do appreciate tenderness to palpation of your midfoot and you are positive for the piano key test on a neurovascular exam of your left foot you have a brisk capillary refill of less than three seconds dorsalis pedis pulse is intact and strong and you do have motor and sensation that it's intact to light touch now i would like to do a review of the diagnostic imaging that you had before you came in so i do notice a subtle dorsal displacement of the base of the second metatarsal with a three millimeter separation of the first and second metatarsal bases and the presence of a bony fragment in the lisfranc joint space so lem me talk to you a little bit about my assessment and plan now for for the first concern of right foot pain your right foot pain is due to a lisfranc fracture which is a fracture to one of your second metatarsal bones at the top of your foot where the metatarsals meet your cuboids now there are ligaments at the top of your foot so i'm gon na be ordering an mri to assess for injury to any of these ligaments now based on your exam and from what i'm seeing on your x-ray you're most likely going to need surgery of that foot now the surgery will place the bones back in their proper position and using plates and screws will hold them there while they heal and this is gon na allow those bones and ligaments to heal properly it is a day surgery and you will be able to go home the same day and then i'm going to have you follow up with me here in the clinic you'll be in a cast and you will need to use crutches and you will not be able to use that left foot for about six to eight weeks now after that six to eight weeks you will gradually start walking on your foot based on how you tolerate it and we'll see how you do at that point so i do believe you're gon na need surgery i i'm recommending this because there are significant complications to your foot if we do not do this poor bone and ligament healing can lead to losing the arch of your foot and you're becoming flat-footed you also have a high likelihood of developing arthritis in that foot so what i'm gon na do unfortunately you'll be out the rest of the season but we are gon na get you fixed up and ready for next season if you're okay with all of this i'm gon na have the nurse come in and get you started on your paperwork and then i will see you on monday morning and we will get your foot taken care of\n[patient] alright thank you\n[doctor] you're welcome",
    "transcript": "[doctor] Good morning, Gabriel. How have you been feeling since our last appointment?\n[patient] Hi, Doctor. Well, honestly, I've been having some issues lately that I wanted to talk to you about.\n[doctor] Of course, Gabriel. Can you describe these issues for me?\n[patient] For the past few weeks, I've been experiencing some unusual fatigue and shortness of breath, especially when I try to do any physical activity.\n[doctor] I see. Have you noticed any changes in your heart rate or have you had any episodes of dizziness or fainting?\n[patient] No fainting, but I do get dizzy sometimes. And my heart does feel like it's beating faster than usual during these episodes.\n[doctor] Alright, that's important to note. Now, you are currently on Warfarin and Aspirin, correct? Can you remind me of the dosages you're taking?\n[patient] Yes, that's right. I'm taking 5 mg of Warfarin every day and 81 mg of Aspirin daily as well.\n[doctor] Good, and have you been consistent with your medication timetable?\n[patient] Yes, I haven't missed a dose. I'm very careful about that, especially with Warfarin, because I know how important it is to keep my blood levels stable.\n[doctor] Absolutely, Gabriel. Adherence to your medication schedule is crucial with anticoagulants like Warfarin. Have you had any recent bleeding episodes or bruising more easily than before?\n[patient] No recent bleeding, but I have noticed a couple of bruises that seemed to appear without any real injury.\n[doctor] Okay, we'll want to keep an eye on that. It could be a sign that your INR levels are higher than they should be, which means your blood might be too thin. We'll do a blood test to check your INR today.\n[patient] Sounds good, Doctor. Is there anything I should be worried about with these symptoms?\n[doctor] We'll need to look at the results of your tests and possibly run a few more to determine the cause of your symptoms. It could be a range of things, but given your history and current medication, I want to rule out any cardiac issues first.\n[patient] I understand. I just don't feel like myself lately, and it's starting to worry me.\n[doctor] That's completely understandable, Gabriel. Your well-being is my priority. Let's go over your current health practices. How's your diet been?\n[patient] I've been trying to stick to a heart-healthy diet, lots of fruits and vegetables, whole grains, and I've cut down on sodium.\n[doctor] Excellent. And any alcohol or tobacco use?\n[patient] No, I quit smoking two years ago, and I rarely drink alcohol, maybe a glass of wine here and there.\n[doctor] That's very good. Smoking and drinking can certainly complicate your condition and interact negatively with your medications. Let's talk about your physical activity. What does that look like these days?\n[patient] Well, I used to walk every morning, but with the fatigue and breathlessness, I've cut down quite a bit. It just doesn't feel right.\n[doctor] I understand that must be frustrating. Physical activity is important, but it's also important to listen to your body. If it's telling you to slow down, it's wise to heed that warning. Now, have you had any recent injuries or surgeries that might be contributing to how you're feeling?\n[patient] No injuries or surgeries, Doctor.\n[doctor] Alright. Now, I'd like to perform a physical examination to check for any abnormalities. I'll listen to your heart and lungs and check for any signs of swelling or pain. After that, we'll get that blood test done.\n[patient] Sounds good. I trust your judgment, Doctor.\n[doctor] Thank you, Gabriel. Your trust is very important to me, and I want to ensure we get to the bottom of this. So, let's start with your vitals. Your blood pressure is 132 over 86, which is a slight elevation from last time. Your heart rate is a bit elevated at 88 beats per minute, but let's not be too concerned until we have more information. Your respiratory rate is 18 breaths per minute, which is within normal limits, but we'll monitor that given your shortness of breath. No fever, which is good, and your oxygen saturation is at 96%, which is acceptable but something to keep an eye on.\n[patient] Okay, I'm glad those are mostly normal.\n[doctor] They are, but we still need to be thorough. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs now. Please sit back and relax as much as you can.\n[patient] Sure thing, Doctor.\n[doctor] (after examination) Your lungs sound clear, but your heart rhythm is a bit irregular. It's possible that this could be contributing to your symptoms. We'll definitely need to follow up with an EKG and an echocardiogram to assess your heart function more closely.\n[patient] I hope it's nothing too serious.\n[doctor] We hope for the best but prepare for all possibilities. Now, regarding the rest of our plan, I'm going to refer you to a cardiologist for a more specialized evaluation, and we'll adjust your medications if necessary based on your INR results and the cardiologist's recommendations.\n[patient] That sounds like a plan, Doctor. I just want to feel better.\n[doctor] And we will do everything we can to achieve that, Gabriel. Let's get you scheduled for those tests and the cardiologist appointment. In the meantime, continue taking your Warfarin and Aspirin as prescribed, and make sure to call us if you notice any worsening of your symptoms or any new concerns.\n[patient] Will do. Thank you for being so thorough. I appreciate it.\n[doctor] Of course, Gabriel. It's what we're here for. We'll see you back here soon for a follow-up, and my staff will help you with the referrals and any necessary paperwork before you leave today. Take care, and we'll speak soon.\n[patient] Thank you, Doctor. I'll see you soon.\n[doctor] You're welcome, Gabriel. Have a good day, and remember, we're here if you need anything before your next visit.",

    "example_transcript": "[doctor] hey linda good to see you today so looking here in my notes looks like you you think you have a kidney stone think you've had them before and and you i guess you're having some pain and while we are here i see you i see you have a you have past medical history of hypertension diabetes and we will check up on those as well so with your kidney stone can you tell me what happened what's going on\n[patient] and i've been in a lot of pain it started about i would say probably about three days ago\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] started having pain on my left back\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] and since then i continued to have pain it is traveling a little lower it's gotten little low but i definitely have not passed it yet and i'm just in so much pain\n[doctor] okay so is the pain that you're having is it constant or does it come and go\n[patient] it's constant\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] all the time i ca n't get comfortable\n[doctor] alright are you able to urinate\n[patient] i am and this morning i actually started seeing some blood\n[doctor] okay yeah so and i know you said i see you've had some kidney stones in the past like how many times would you say you've had one of these episodes\n[patient] i've had it for probably this might be my third time\n[doctor] third time alright\n[patient] yeah i have n't had one in a while but yeah this is my third time\n[doctor] okay so have you noticed any nausea chills fever\n[patient] no fever some chills and i i just in so much pain i i ca n't eat and i do feel a little nauseous\n[doctor] okay that sound definitely understandable so you've been in a lot of pain so have you tried to take any medications to alleviate the pain\n[patient] yeah i've been taking tylenol i have had to try some ibuprofen i know you said to be careful with my blood pressure but i have been trying to do that because i'm just in so much pain and it's not really working\n[doctor] okay and before what would you how long would you say it took you to pass the other stones or how was that that resolved\n[patient] yeah usually usually about about three four days to pass it yeah\n[doctor] right so this is this is the looks like this is the third day\n[patient] yeah\n[doctor] so we are getting close there\n[patient] okay\n[doctor] yeah so hopefully we can pass it but we'll i'll definitely we can take a look at it here in a second so while you are here i also wanted to check up on your your diabetes and and hypertension you have so i'm looking here at my notes and you're on two . five of norvasc for your high blood pressure when you came in today your blood pressure was a was a little bit high and i know that's probably because you are in a bunch of pain so that definitely makes sense but i think last time we talked a little bit about you getting a blood pressure cuff and taking your blood pressures regularly so those readings first off were you able to get the blood pressure cuff\n[patient] i was i have n't been great about taking it but i did get the blood pressure cuff\n[doctor] so the time that you did take it and i think that's something we got to work on is you've taken them i think at least three times a week i would like you to what have those been running\n[patient] like the top numbers they're usually the one thirties sometimes i get i do go into one forties and once it went to like one fifty\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] and then the bottom number has been between seventy and eighty okay that i mean that's not too bad i think when you were first diagnosed you were up there in the\n[doctor] the one eighties which was really high\n[patient] right\n[doctor] so let me talk a little bit also about you trying to lower your salt intake to like like twenty three hundred milligrams a a day so have you been able to do that\n[patient] trying my best but doc i really like my french fries\n[doctor] yeah\n[patient] like\n[doctor] we we all like we all like the french fries you know but you know we we we we also do n't like strokes so we do n't want to have a scope and all the all the french fries so that's something definitely i would like you to work on and do you think you'd be able to to curb that french fry habit or that bad this bad food habits by yourself or do you think you need help\n[patient] yeah some help could be helpful okay yeah we can definitely get you connected with someone just to help you with your diet kinda that's the biggest thing for a lot of my patient is trying to control that diet alright\n[doctor] so i also want to take a look here at your diabetes and last time you came in your a1c was a little bit higher at seven . three and you're on five hundred of metformin currently so have you been taking your blood sugars before you eat everyday\n[patient] i have and those those have been pretty good they are like in the low one hundreds\n[doctor] okay that that that's definitely good because when you came in i think we did a glucose test on you couple of months ago and you were around three hundred which is which is pretty up there so i'm glad that you know those levels are down and have you been taking that metformin everyday\n[patient] i do\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] i do take it\n[doctor] that that that that's really good alright so let me do a quick physical exam on you just a couple of questions before i take a look at your your abdomen and and your back talked to take a look at that that kidney stones you're having so i just want to make sure are you having any any chest pain\n[patient] no chest pain\n[doctor] no chest pain are you having any belly pain\n[patient] the back pain is starting to kind of go down into my groin but i would n't say any back pain i mean abdominal pain\n[doctor] no abdominal pain alright so let me check here i'm gon na listen to your heart real quick and so on your heart exam i do hear a grade two out of six systolic ejection murmur and that we knew about that already so not really worried about that currently listen to your lungs your lungs are clear bilaterally i do n't hear any crackles or wheezes so let me press here on your abdomen does that hurt\n[patient] yes\n[doctor] okay i'm gon na press here on your back is that painful\n[patient] yes\n[doctor] alright so on your examination of your abdomen there is tenderness to palpation of the abdomen there is n't any rebound or guarding though and only there is also cva tinnitus on the right on your on your flank as well and so it seems to me you know that you do have that kidney stone looks like you do have some inflammation around your kidney that's what that that's that tenderness around your cva is is telling me so let's go talk a little bit about my assessment and plan for you so you know right now because of your history of of having kidney stones you you do have a kidney stone so what we're gon na do is first off i'm gon na get you some pain medication kinda you're in a ton of pain right now i'm gon na prescribe you some oxycodone five milligrams you can take that every six to eight hours as needed for pain and so hopefully that can help you feeling better and you can continue to take that tylenol for any breakthrough pain that you're having i do wan na make sure that you're pushing fluids right now because we need to try to push that stone out that you're having just kinda clear your kidneys and that that would definitely help i also want to give you a strainer so you can strain your urine to see if you do actually pass that stone and then i'm going to refer you to urology and we're actually i'm gon na have you you even if you pass a stone in the next couple of days i want you to go anyway because it seems like you're having recurrent kidney stones and so hopefully they can help do something to to help this from happening in the future for your hypertension i'm gon na keep you on that two . five norvasc your your blood pressures look good so i'm not gon na make any changes there and then for your diabetes we'll keep you on the five hundred of metformin and i also want to give you a referral to nutrition to a dietitian and they will be able to help you with your your diet i know you said you have a few issues so you know they can possibly write a diet for you and if you follow it you know hopefully in the future we can get you off of both of these medications and get you back to normal so how does that all sound\n[patient] that sounds good and i i just i just want this pain to go away so thank you\n[doctor] okay no problem",
    "transcript": "[doctor] Good morning, Jacob. It's nice to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last appointment?\n\n[patient] Hi Doctor. Honestly, I've been better. I've been dealing with some fatigue and just generally not feeling myself lately.\n\n[doctor] I see. Well, let's take a look at what might be going on. I've got your chart here, and I see that you're currently on Levothyroxine. How long have you been taking that?\n\n[patient] It's been about six months now. I started on a lower dose, but you increased it last time. I\u2019ve been on 50 micrograms daily since then.\n\n[doctor] Alright, that's good to know. Have you been taking the Levothyroxine consistently every morning on an empty stomach?\n\n[patient] Yes, I have. I set an alarm to make sure I don\u2019t miss it.\n\n[doctor] Excellent adherence, Jacob. Now, fatigue can be a common symptom if the dosage of Levothyroxine isn't quite right. Have you noticed any other symptoms, such as weight changes, hair loss, or feeling cold more often?\n\n[patient] I haven't really noticed any hair loss, but I do feel cold quite often. And I think I may have gained a few pounds, even though my diet hasn't changed much.\n\n[doctor] Alright. These could be signs that your thyroid levels aren't fully optimized yet. We\u2019ll need to check your TSH levels again to ensure your dosage is on target.\n\n[patient] I was wondering if that might be the issue. I hope we can get it sorted out.\n\n[doctor] Definitely, we'll work on it. Now, aside from the fatigue, how is your mood? Any signs of depression or anxiety?\n\n[patient] I've been a bit more down than usual, I guess. It\u2019s hard to tell if it\u2019s just because I\u2019m tired all the time or if it's something more.\n\n[doctor] It's not uncommon for thyroid issues to affect mood. We'll keep an eye on that as well.\n\n[patient] That's reassuring to hear.\n\n[doctor] How about your appetite and bowel movements \u2013 any changes there?\n\n[patient] My appetite is a bit lower than usual, but nothing drastic. Bowel movements are a bit irregular, though.\n\n[doctor] Okay, that could also be related to your thyroid function. Now, have you experienced any heart palpitations or tremors?\n\n[patient] No, nothing like that.\n\n[doctor] That's good. And how about your sleep? Are you having trouble sleeping?\n\n[patient] Yes, actually. It's been hard to fall asleep, and I wake up a few times during the night.\n\n[doctor] Sleep disturbances can definitely contribute to your daytime fatigue. We'll need to consider that in our overall assessment.\n\n[patient] I hope we can figure it out. I just want to feel normal again.\n\n[doctor] We'll do our best, Jacob. Now, regarding your family history, have there been any new developments or diagnoses since we last spoke?\n\n[patient] Not that I\u2019m aware of. It\u2019s been pretty much the same.\n\n[doctor] Good, good. And how about your personal life? Any major stresses or changes that could be affecting your health?\n\n[patient] Work has been stressful, but no more than usual. No big changes or anything.\n\n[doctor] Alright. It's important to manage stress as it can impact your thyroid and overall health. We might explore some stress-reduction techniques if necessary.\n\n[patient] That might be helpful, yes.\n\n[doctor] Since you're here, we should also do a brief physical examination, if that's alright with you.\n\n[patient] Sure, go ahead.\n\n[doctor] I'm going to start by checking your thyroid gland. Let me know if you feel any discomfort while I palpate your neck.\n\n[patient] No discomfort.\n\n[doctor] The thyroid gland doesn't seem enlarged, and I don\u2019t feel any nodules. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs.\n\n[patient] Okay.\n\n[doctor] Your heart rhythm is regular, no murmurs, and your lungs sound clear. That's good. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes.\n\n[patient] Alright.\n\n[doctor] Reflexes are within normal limits. No signs of hyperreflexia, which is good. Lastly, I'm going to check for any signs of edema in your legs.\n\n[patient] What are you looking for exactly?\n\n[doctor] Swelling that can indicate fluid retention, often seen in hypothyroidism. But your legs look fine. No pitting edema.\n\n[patient] That's good to hear.\n\n[doctor] Absolutely. So, based on today's visit, I think the next step is to get your thyroid levels checked. We need to see if we need to adjust the Levothyroxine. I also want to order a complete blood count and a metabolic panel to rule out any other causes for your fatigue.\n\n[patient] Sounds like a plan.\n\n[doctor] In addition, I'm going to refer you to a dietitian. Optimizing your diet can help with energy levels and might also address the slight weight gain you've mentioned.\n\n[patient] I'd appreciate that. I want to do everything I can to improve my situation.\n\n[doctor] I'm glad to hear that. It's important to take a comprehensive approach.\n\n[patient] When will we know the results of the blood tests?\n\n[doctor] We should have the results within a week. I'll schedule a follow-up appointment for you so we can discuss the findings and next steps.\n\n[patient] Thank you, Doctor. It's a relief to have a clear plan moving forward.\n\n[doctor] You're welcome, Jacob. It's what I'm here for. Remember, managing your thyroid condition is a journey, and we'll make adjustments as needed. In the meantime, try to maintain a healthy routine and get enough rest.\n\n[patient] I will. Thanks for your help today.\n\n[doctor] My pleasure. Take care, Jacob, and I'll see you at the follow-up. If anything changes or you have any concerns before then, don't hesitate to call the office.\n\n[patient] Will do. See you soon.\n\n[doctor] Goodbye, Jacob.",

pressure cuff i asked you to have you been checking your blood pressure at home\n[patient] periodically yes\n[doctor] okay and do you think that they are running okay\n[patient] yeah blood pressure seems to be doing okay the lisinopril works well\n[doctor] good i was just gon na ask you if you were taking your lisinopril so that's good okay and any side effects from the lisinopril since we started it i think we started it about a year ago two years ago\n[patient] no no no side effects that i'm aware of\n[doctor] no side effects okay and then in terms of your diabetes are you watching your sugar intake\n[patient] yeah i usually watch it the form of high what i'm eating but\n[doctor] i am a big pie fan as well i know what's your favorite type of pie\n[patient] well you know it's favorite boy i just like pie you know apples cherry chocolate you know bicon\n[doctor] yeah\n[patient] i try to try to avoid the bicon because i think it's just all sugar but i do like it\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] less\n[doctor] i like it too alright are you taking the metformin twice a day\n[patient] not everyday but most of the time\n[doctor] okay alright and are you checking your blood sugars pretty regularly\n[patient] i try to\n[doctor] okay and do you do you know on average how they're running are they running below like one fifty or\n[patient] yeah it's definitely running below that\n[doctor] okay your blood sugars are running below\n[patient] it's it's probably with with with the metformin it seems to be you know one twenty\n[doctor] good\n[patient] pretty regular\n[doctor] good your blood sugars are running in the one twenties that's really good okay alright well i wan na just go ahead and do a quick physical exam okay so i'm looking here at your vital signs and your vital signs look really good i do think you're doing a good job with taking your lisinopril your blood pressure's about one twenty two over seventy right now which is right where we want it your heart rate is nice and slow at sixty seven again which is right where we want it and i do n't appreciate any fever today you you have a normal temperature at ninety eight . four which is really good so i'm just gon na be going ahead and calling out some physical exam findings and i'm gon na let you know what that means when i'm done okay so on your heart exam your heart is in a nice regular rate and rhythm i do n't appreciate any murmur rub or gallop on your lung exam your lungs are nice and clear to auscultation bilaterally on your right knee exam i do appreciate some erythema and edema as well as an area of fluctuance over your right patella now does it hurt when i press\n[patient] it's a little bit sore\n[doctor] okay there is pain to palpation of the right anterior knee and i'm just gon na bend your knee up and down does that hurt at all\n[patient] no no it's just more of the typical grinding that i would feel\n[doctor] okay there is full range of motion of the right knee and on skin examination there is evidence of a bull's-eye rash over the right knee okay so what does that mean richard so that means that you know you do have some area of some inflammation over the over the right knee where you where you have that tick bite and you do have what we call that bull's eye rash which is what we get concerned about with with lyme disease so let's just talk a little bit about you know my assessment and my plan for you okay so for this first problem of your of your tick bite my concern is that you might have lyme disease based on the presentation of your right knee so i'm gon na go ahead and start you on doxycycline one hundred milligrams twice a day\n[patient] we're gon na continue that for about three weeks i'm also gon na go ahead and send a lyme titer as well as a western blot to see if you do in fact have lyme lyme disease and we'll have to go ahead and just see how you do with this we you know i'd like to avoid intravenous antibiotics which i think we can avoid but i wanted to see how you do so\n[doctor] do you have any questions about that\n[patient] yeah i did n't know what those last two things or just\n[doctor] yeah so so we are gon na start you on some antibiotics to help help you with this\n[patient] you know possible lyme disease and i'm gon na just order some blood tests just to see exactly what's going on and then you know sometimes people need intravenous antibiotics because lyme disease can cause problems on other organs like your heart that type of thing\n[doctor] if not treated appropriately and sometimes we need to give antibiotics through the iv which i'd like to avoid i think that we got this early enough that we can just treat you with some oral antibiotics okay for your second problem of your hypertension you know i think you're doing a really good job let's go ahead and continue you on the lisinopril twenty milligrams once a day and i wan na just go ahead and order a lipid panel just to make sure that everything is okay with your cholesterol how does that sound\n[patient] that's fine\n[doctor] great and then for your third problem of your diabetes i wan na just go ahead and order a hemoglobin a1c and continue you on the metformin one thousand milligrams twice a day it sounds like you're doing a good job since your blood sugars are running in the one twenties i do n't think we need to make any adjustments but we'll see what the hemoglobin a1c shows that gives us a an idea of what your blood sugars are doing on a long-term basis how does that sound\n[patient] okay at what point time do you start kinda checking kidney function i've been told that metformin can possibly cause some kidney issues\n[doctor] so it can you know your kidney function we've you know i think you've been really lucky it's been normal i checked it about two months ago and it looks pretty good it looks pretty normal but since we're doing blood work on you i can go ahead and order a a basic metabolic panel just to make sure that your kidney function is stable\n[patient] okay that'd be good\n[doctor] okay anything else\n[patient] not that i can think of at this time as soon as i leave\n[doctor] well you know where to find me okay\n[patient] alright\n[doctor] take care bye",
    "transcript": "[doctor] Good morning, Ella. How have you been feeling since our last appointment?\n[patient] Hi, Doctor. I\u2019ve been managing, but it\u2019s been a bit rough, to be honest.\n[doctor] I'm sorry to hear that. Can you tell me more about what's been going on?\n[patient] Well, ever since I started on the Prednisone, I\u2019ve noticed some changes. I\u2019m not sure if they\u2019re side effects or something else.\n[doctor] Prednisone can certainly have some side effects. What dosage are you currently on?\n[patient] I\u2019m taking 20 mg once daily, like you prescribed last time.\n[doctor] Okay, that\u2019s a standard starting dose. What specific changes or symptoms are you noticing?\n[patient] I've been feeling really jittery, and I can't seem to sleep well. Plus, my appetite has gone through the roof. I\u2019m always hungry.\n[doctor] Increased appetite and difficulty sleeping are common side effects of Prednisone. The jitteriness could also be related. Have you noticed any swelling in your ankles or changes in your mood?\n[patient] Yeah, my ankles do seem a bit swollen. And mood-wise, I get irritated more easily than before.\n[doctor] Those are also known side effects of Prednisone. How about your original symptoms? Has there been any improvement in the condition we\u2019re treating with the Prednisone?\n[patient] My joint pain has improved, which is great, but these side effects are making me a bit miserable.\n[doctor] I understand. It\u2019s important to find a balance between managing your condition and minimizing side effects. We might need to adjust your dosage or try a different approach. Have you been taking the Prednisone with food?\n[patient] Yes, I always take it with my breakfast.\n[doctor] Good, that can help reduce some gastrointestinal side effects. Have you noticed any unusual bruising or bleeding?\n[patient] Not that I can recall, no.\n[doctor] That's reassuring. Prednisone can sometimes affect clotting mechanisms. It's important to monitor for such signs. Now, let's do a quick review of your overall health. How has your energy level been?\n[patient] It fluctuates. Some days I feel okay, but other days I'm just drained.\n[doctor] Fatigue can be both a symptom of your underlying condition and a side effect of the medication. Have you been able to stay active or has the fatigue interfered with your daily activities?\n[patient] I try to go for walks when I can, but some days I don't have the energy for it.\n[doctor] It's good that you're trying to stay active. Exercise can help with energy levels and mood. Now, how about your water intake? Are you staying hydrated?\n[patient] I think so. I drink water throughout the day.\n[doctor] Excellent. Staying hydrated is important, especially when on Prednisone. Let's talk about your diet. Have you made any changes recently?\n[patient] I\u2019ve been trying to eat healthier, lots of fruits and vegetables, since my appetite increased. I\u2019m trying to avoid gaining weight from all the extra eating.\n[doctor] That\u2019s very proactive of you. A balanced diet can help manage some of the side effects you\u2019re experiencing. Now, have you had any issues with your vision?\n[patient] No, my vision has been fine.\n[doctor] Good. Prednisone can sometimes cause vision problems. If you notice any changes, you should let me know immediately. Have you been taking any other medications or supplements?\n[patient] Just a multivitamin in the morning.\n[doctor] Alright. It's always a good idea to check with me or your pharmacist before starting any new medications or supplements. They can interact with Prednisone. Let's do a physical exam now and check your vitals. Please roll up your sleeve, and we\u2019ll check your blood pressure first.\n[patient] Sure, go ahead.\n[doctor] Your blood pressure is a bit higher than last time but still within an acceptable range. This can be a side effect of Prednisone as well. We\u2019ll need to keep an eye on it. Now I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs.\n[patient] Okay.\n[doctor] Your heart rate is slightly elevated, but the rhythm is regular. Lungs are clear. I don't hear any wheezing or crackles. The swelling in your ankles \u2013 I want to take a look at that. Can you please remove your shoes and socks?\n[patient] Of course, here you go.\n[doctor] I see some slight edema. Does it hurt when I press here?\n[patient] It\u2019s a little tender, yes.\n[doctor] The swelling is likely related to the Prednisone. We may need to adjust your dose if it persists. Now, let's check your reflexes and muscle strength. Can you squeeze my hand as hard as you can?\n[patient] Sure, like this?\n[doctor] Yes, that's good. Strength seems normal. Reflexes are also within normal limits. Let's talk about your treatment plan moving forward. Given the side effects you're experiencing, we may need to consider tapering down the Prednisone dose gradually.\n[patient] If that could help with the side effects, I'd be willing to try it.\n[doctor] We need to do it carefully to avoid a flare-up of your symptoms. I'll also order some blood tests to monitor your response to the medication and check for any other issues that might be contributing to your symptoms.\n[patient] What kind of blood tests?\n[doctor] We'll do a complete blood count, liver and kidney function tests, and a check for your blood sugar levels since Prednisone can affect glucose regulation.\n[patient] Makes sense. When will I get the results?\n[doctor] Typically, it takes a few days. I'll call you as soon as we have all the results. In the meantime, we'll start tapering your Prednisone to 15 mg daily and see how you do with that.\n[patient] Alright. I hope that helps with the side effects.\n[doctor] We'll monitor you closely. It's important to come in for a follow-up in two weeks, or sooner if your symptoms worsen or if you have concerns.\n[patient] I can do that. Is there anything else I should be doing at home?\n[doctor] Keep up with the healthy diet, stay hydrated, and try to maintain some level of physical activity. Make sure to get enough rest, and we can also discuss some strategies to improve your sleep.\n[patient] That would be helpful. Thank you, Doctor.\n[doctor] You're welcome, Ella. Remember, you can always reach out to our office if you need anything before your next appointment. Take care and we\u2019ll see you soon.\n[patient] Will do. See you in two weeks.\n[doctor] Take care, Ella. Goodbye.",

    "transcript": "[doctor] Good morning, Mr. Juan Martinez. It's great to see you for your follow-up appointment. How have you been feeling since our last visit?\n\n[patient] Good morning, Doctor. Well, I've been doing okay, but I've had a few rough days. I've been trying to keep up with everything you've recommended.\n\n[doctor] That's good to hear that you're trying. I see that you're currently on Losartan 50mg daily and Hydrochlorothiazide 25mg daily for your hypertension. Have you been taking these medications as prescribed?\n\n[patient] Yes, I take the Losartan every morning and the Hydrochlorothiazide as well. Sometimes I forget if I've taken them because my routine changes, but I usually remember.\n\n[doctor] It's important to take your medication consistently. Maybe you could use a pillbox or set an alarm to help you remember. How about any side effects? Have you noticed anything unusual since you started these medications?\n\n[patient] I've been feeling a bit dizzy at times, and I've noticed I go to the bathroom more often because of the Hydrochlorothiazide, I guess.\n\n[doctor] Those are common side effects, especially with Hydrochlorothiazide, as it's a diuretic. The dizziness could be related to a drop in your blood pressure, so we need to monitor that closely. Have you been checking your blood pressure at home?\n\n[patient] Yeah, I bought a blood pressure monitor like you suggested last time. I check it every other day.\n\n[doctor] Excellent. Keeping track of your blood pressure is crucial. Can you recall any readings you've had recently?\n\n[patient] They've been mostly around 140 over 90. I think that's better than before, right?\n\n[doctor] That's an improvement, but our goal is to get you below 130/80 to really minimize your risks of complications. We may need to adjust your medications if we can't reach that target through lifestyle changes and the current regimen. Speaking of which, how is your diet and exercise routine going?\n\n[patient] It's been tough. I try to walk every day, but with my job, it's hard to find the time. As for my diet, I've cut down on salty foods but haven't made too many other changes.\n\n[doctor] Diet and exercise are just as important as medication in managing hypertension. Let's talk about some strategies to help you improve in those areas. Have you considered meeting with a dietitian?\n\n[patient] No, I haven't, but it sounds like a good idea.\n\n[doctor] I think it would be very beneficial. A dietitian can create a personalized meal plan that fits your lifestyle and helps you manage your blood pressure. I'll write a referral for you. In the meantime, let's focus on increasing fruits, vegetables, and whole grains while decreasing red meat, processed foods, and high-sodium products. Now, let's do a quick check-up. Please roll up your sleeve so I can take your blood pressure.\n\n[patient] Sure thing, Doctor.\n\n[doctor] The reading is 136 over 88. It's a bit high, but we're within range. I'm going to listen to your heart now.\n\n[doctor] Your heart sounds strong, no murmurs or irregularities. Let's check your weight. Have you noticed any weight changes recently?\n\n[patient] I've lost a couple of pounds, but nothing significant.\n\n[doctor] Weight management is key in controlling blood pressure. Even a small weight loss can have a big impact. Let's set a goal for you to lose a bit more. Now, I'll take a look at your lower extremities for any swelling.\n\n[doctor] Everything seems normal there. How about any headaches, vision changes, or anything else out of the ordinary?\n\n[patient] I've had some minor headaches, but I thought they were just stress-related.\n\n[doctor] Headaches can be a symptom of high blood pressure, so let's keep an eye on that. Make sure to stay hydrated, especially with the Hydrochlorothiazide, which can cause you to lose more fluid. Regarding your Losartan, have you had any issues with a persistent cough or anything like that?\n\n[patient] No, no cough or anything.\n\n[doctor] Good to know. Some patients experience a cough with ACE inhibitors, but Losartan is usually better tolerated. Now, I want to review the importance of not missing your doses. It's crucial for maintaining steady blood pressure. Have you been able to avoid alcohol and tobacco as well?\n\n[patient] I don't smoke, and I've cut back on alcohol. Just an occasional beer now and then.\n\n[doctor] That's great, Juan. Both smoking and excess alcohol can raise blood pressure, so continue to limit your alcohol intake. Now, I want to order some blood work to monitor your kidney function, as the medications you're on can affect it. We'll also check your electrolytes because Hydrochlorothiazide can cause imbalances.\n\n[patient] Alright, should I schedule another appointment to discuss the results?\n\n[doctor] Yes, we'll schedule a follow-up after the results come in. It's important to ensure that your kidney function is stable and that your electrolyte levels are where they should be. In the meantime, please continue with your Losartan and Hydrochlorothiazide, and try to implement the lifestyle changes we discussed. Do you have any questions or concerns?\n\n[patient] No, I think I've got it. I'll work on my diet and make sure to take my meds every day. Thanks for helping me out, Doctor.\n\n[doctor] You're welcome, Juan. It's my job to help you stay healthy. Remember to pick up a scale, if you don't have one already, and weigh yourself daily. Sudden weight gain can be a sign of worsening heart health. And please don't hesitate to call the office if you have any issues or if your blood pressure readings get higher. Take care, and I'll see you after we get your test results.\n\n[patient] Will do. Thanks again, Doctor. \n\n[doctor] You're welcome, Juan. Have a good day and take care of yourself.",

    "transcript": "[doctor] Good morning, Aria. How have you been feeling since your last visit?\n\n[patient] Hi, Doctor. Well, I've been managing okay, but this persistent rash has been bothering me a lot.\n\n[doctor] I see. And how long has this rash been present?\n\n[patient] It's been almost two weeks now.\n\n[doctor] Alright. Before we continue, I'd like to confirm the medications you're currently taking. Are you still on Doxycycline?\n\n[patient] Yes, I am. I've been taking 100 mg twice a day, as prescribed.\n\n[doctor] Good, that's an appropriate dosage. Has there been any improvement with your symptoms since you started the Doxycycline?\n\n[patient] Not really, the rash is still quite itchy and seems to be spreading a bit.\n\n[doctor] Okay, let's take a look. Can you show me where the rash is?\n\n[patient] Sure, it's mainly on my arms and legs, and a little on my chest.\n\n[doctor] I'm going to put on some gloves and take a closer look, if that's okay with you.\n\n[patient] That's fine.\n\n[doctor] [examining the rash] I can see it's quite red and inflamed. Does it feel warm to the touch?\n\n[patient] Yes, it does, and it's pretty sensitive.\n\n[doctor] Any fever or other symptoms?\n\n[patient] I've felt a bit run down, but no fever.\n\n[doctor] Alright. You mentioned you're on Doxycycline\u2014may I ask what condition it was prescribed for?\n\n[patient] It was for a mild case of Lyme disease I was diagnosed with about three weeks ago.\n\n[doctor] I see. And when did the rash start in relation to beginning the antibiotic?\n\n[patient] The rash came up about a week after I started the medication.\n\n[doctor] Alright, it's possible that what we're seeing could be a reaction to the Doxycycline, but we'll need to consider other causes as well. I'd like to run some tests to rule out any other potential issues. In the meantime, it's important to monitor for any signs of an allergic reaction, such as difficulty breathing or swelling of the face and lips. Have you experienced anything like that?\n\n[patient] No, nothing like that.\n\n[doctor] Good. For now, let's take some precautionary measures. I'll prescribe an antihistamine to help with the itching and an anti-inflammatory cream to apply to the rash. I want to make sure we're not dealing with a more serious skin condition or a systemic reaction.\n\n[patient] Okay, that sounds good.\n\n[doctor] We'll also need to consider whether the Doxycycline is still appropriate for your Lyme disease treatment, given this potential reaction. I'm going to consult with a specialist to determine if we should switch you to a different antibiotic. I'd like you to come back in three days for a follow-up, sooner if the rash worsens or you develop any concerning symptoms.\n\n[patient] Understood. I'll be sure to come back if anything changes.\n\n[doctor] Excellent. Now, let's talk about managing the rash at home. I recommend you avoid hot showers, as heat can aggravate the rash. Use lukewarm water instead, and try to use fragrance-free soaps and lotions to minimize irritation.\n\n[patient] Got it. I'll make sure to do that.\n\n[doctor] Good. And Aria, with the antihistamine, it can cause drowsiness, so be cautious if you're driving or operating heavy machinery.\n\n[patient] I'll be careful, thanks for letting me know.\n\n[doctor] Of course. Now, Aria, I'm prescribing an antihistamine for the itchiness, and I want you to take it once daily. For the cream, apply it to the affected areas twice a day. Also, continue taking the Doxycycline as we discussed, until we decide on any changes. Make sure to take it with a full glass of water and avoid too much sun exposure, as Doxycycline can make you more sensitive to sunlight.\n\n[patient] I'll make sure to follow those instructions.\n\n[doctor] Excellent. Now, do you have any questions or concerns about the new medications or anything else?\n\n[patient] No, I think I've got it all. Just hoping this rash clears up soon.\n\n[doctor] We're going to do everything we can to help with that. Remember, if the rash spreads significantly or you experience any new symptoms, please call our office immediately or go to the emergency room.\n\n[patient] Will do, Doctor. Thank you for your help today.\n\n[doctor] You're welcome, Aria. We'll see you back here in a few days for that follow-up. Take care until then.\n\n[patient] Thanks, see you soon.\n\n[doctor] Take care, Aria, and don't hesitate to reach out if you need anything before your next appointment.",

    "transcript": "[doctor] Good morning, Aria. How have you been feeling since our last visit?\n[patient] Hi, Doctor. Honestly, I've been better. I've been experiencing a lot of discomfort in my lower back recently.\n[doctor] I'm sorry to hear that. Can you describe the discomfort for me? Is it a sharp pain, a dull ache, or something else?\n[patient] It's like a constant dull ache, but sometimes there are sharp pains that come and go. It gets worse when I'm sitting for a long time.\n[doctor] Understood. Have there been any recent changes in your activity level or any new stressors that might be contributing to this?\n[patient] Well, I started a new job, and it requires me to sit at a desk most of the day. I guess that could be making it worse.\n[doctor] It's very possible. We'll talk about ways to manage that. But first, let's address your current medication. You're on Gabapentin, correct? What dosage are you taking?\n[patient] Yes, that's right. I take Gabapentin, 300mg three times a day for neuropathy.\n[doctor] And how is that working for you? Any issues with the medication or side effects that you've noticed?\n[patient] I think it helps with the nerve pain, but I've been feeling a bit drowsy since I started taking it. Not sure if it's related.\n[doctor] Drowsiness can be a side effect of Gabapentin. We'll keep an eye on that. Now, let's focus on your back pain. Is there anything you've tried at home to alleviate the pain?\n[patient] I've tried using a heating pad and doing some stretches that I found online. They help a little, but the relief doesn't last long.\n[doctor] That's a good start. Heat therapy and stretching can be beneficial. We might consider adding a physical therapy regimen to strengthen your back muscles and improve your posture, especially considering your desk job. But let's do a physical exam first. Please lie down on the examination table for me, and we'll check your spine and muscle tone.\n[patient] Okay, Doctor.\n\n[doctor] (After the examination) Your spine alignment seems normal, and muscle tone is good, but I can see the discomfort when I apply pressure to the lower lumbar area. Have you had any radiating pain or numbness in your legs?\n[patient] No, nothing like that. Just the back pain.\n[doctor] That's good; it means we're likely not dealing with any nerve impingement or disc issues. However, I want to order some imaging tests to rule out any underlying conditions. We'll start with an X-ray and possibly an MRI if necessary. Now, regarding your back pain, I'd like to suggest a few changes to your medication regimen. We'll continue with the Gabapentin for now, but I'll also prescribe a muscle relaxant to help ease the discomfort in your back, especially at the end of your workday. We'll start with a low dose and adjust as needed.\n\n[patient] I'm willing to try that if you think it'll help.\n[doctor] I believe it will. In addition to the medication, I'm going to refer you to a physical therapist who specializes in occupational-related back strain. They'll work with you on exercises and ergonomic adjustments for your workspace. Now, how's your overall mood been, Aria? Any signs of anxiety or depression?\n[patient] Sometimes I feel a bit down about the pain, but I wouldn't say I'm depressed. It's just frustrating, you know?\n[doctor] Of course, it's perfectly normal to feel that way given the circumstances. Chronic pain can take a toll on your mental health. We have resources available if you ever feel like you need support in that area.\n\n[patient] I appreciate that, Doctor. I'll keep it in mind.\n[doctor] Excellent. I'd also like to schedule a follow-up in four weeks to reassess your back pain and see how the new medication is working. In the meantime, please call the office if your pain worsens or if you have any concerns about the treatment plan.\n[patient] Will do. Thanks for your help today.\n[doctor] It's my pleasure, Aria. We'll do everything we can to get you feeling better. Remember to pick up the prescription for the muscle relaxant on your way out, and I'll have my assistant give you the information for the physical therapist. Take care, and I'll see you at the next appointment.\n[patient] Thank you, Doctor. See you next time.\n\n[doctor] You're welcome. Goodbye for now, and remember to take care of yourself, Aria.",

    "transcript": "[doctor] Good morning, Ella. How are you feeling today?\n\n[patient] Hi, Doctor. I\u2019ve been better, honestly. I\u2019ve been using my Albuterol inhaler more frequently, about every four hours over the past few days.\n\n[doctor] I see. That's quite often. Is it helping with your symptoms?\n\n[patient] It does give me relief, but it's temporary. I'm still feeling pretty short of breath most of the time.\n\n[doctor] Okay, let's dive into this a bit more. When did you start noticing an increase in your symptoms?\n\n[patient] It started about a week ago. I thought it might just be my usual asthma acting up, but it hasn't gotten any better.\n\n[doctor] Have there been any changes in your environment or routine that could possibly trigger this?\n\n[patient] Not that I can think of, no. My routine has been the same, and I haven't been around any new allergens or irritants.\n\n[doctor] All right, Ella. Can you tell me the dosage of your Albuterol inhaler?\n\n[patient] It's the standard metered dose inhaler \u2013 two puffs of 90 micrograms each.\n\n[doctor] Perfect, thanks for confirming. And how about other symptoms? Any cough, fever, or wheezing?\n\n[patient] I've had some wheezing, especially at night. It wakes me up sometimes.\n\n[doctor] That's concerning. We want to make sure you're getting enough air and not working too hard to breathe. Let's get some vitals and perform a respiratory examination. I'll listen to your lungs and check for any signs of distress.\n\n[patient] Sure, that sounds good.\n\n[doctor] [after examination] Your lung sounds are a bit diminished, and I hear some wheezing. There's no sign of infection, which is good. Your oxygen saturation is on the lower side of the normal range. We definitely need to address this.\n\n[patient] Yeah, I've been feeling like I can't take a deep breath.\n\n[doctor] Let's start with a spirometry test to measure your lung function. Depending on the results, we may need to adjust your medication or add a new treatment to help manage your symptoms better.\n\n[patient] What kind of medication or treatment are you considering?\n\n[doctor] Depending on your spirometry results, we might consider adding an inhaled corticosteroid to reduce inflammation in your airways, or a long-acting bronchodilator to help keep them open.\n\n[patient] I just want to feel like I can breathe normally again.\n\n[doctor] I understand, Ella. It's important to manage your asthma effectively. Let's also talk about your inhaler technique. Are you shaking the canister well and using a spacer?\n\n[patient] I do shake it, but I don't use a spacer. Should I be?\n\n[doctor] Yes, a spacer can help ensure that the medication is delivered properly to your lungs. I'll have a nurse show you how to use one before you leave today.\n\n[patient] That would be helpful, thank you.\n\n[doctor] In the meantime, I'm also going to prescribe a course of oral corticosteroids to help reduce inflammation quickly. You'll take prednisone 40 mg once daily for five days.\n\n[patient] Is there anything I should be aware of with that medication?\n\n[doctor] Some people experience increased appetite, mood changes, or difficulty sleeping. It's also important to take it with food to prevent stomach upset.\n\n[patient] I\u2019ll keep that in mind.\n\n[doctor] Good. Now, I want to see you again in two weeks to assess how you\u2019re responding to the treatment. If there's no improvement, we may need to consider additional tests, like a chest X-ray or allergy testing to rule out other causes.\n\n[patient] Okay, I can do that. I just hope this gets sorted out soon.\n\n[doctor] We'll work on it together, Ella. Asthma can be challenging, but with the right treatment plan, we can get your symptoms under control.\n\n[patient] I appreciate your help, Doctor.\n\n[doctor] Of course. Now, let's get you scheduled for that spirometry test and have my nurse go over the spacer technique with you. We'll also get your prescription sorted out. If you have any concerns before our next appointment, don't hesitate to call the office.\n\n[patient] Will do. Thank you for taking the time to help me figure this out.\n\n[doctor] It's my pleasure, Ella. We'll get you feeling better soon. See you in two weeks, and take care.\n\n[patient] Thanks, Doctor. See you soon.\n\n[doctor] You're welcome. My nurse will come in shortly with your new prescriptions and instructions. Have a good day, Ella.\n\n[patient] You too, Doctor. Goodbye.\n\n[doctor] Goodbye, Ella.",

almost a year and then things just started getting really stressful at work they started laying people off and i'm happy i still have a job but that also meant that i was responsible for more things so things just got stressful and i and just started picking it up again\n[doctor] well you are absolutely correct you know stress can often be a trigger for things like smoking and drinking have you thought what you would do this time when you encountered the stressful situations\n[patient] yeah i i did n't think about that a lot actually and one thing is i have started learning and trying to do more meditation and then i also just recently joined the gym so i'm really looking forward to working out again\n[doctor] okay well that's great to hear that you're getting back in the gym that will be good for your long term health too you know helping to maintain that type two diabetes you know those are really great strategies talking about gym for stress relief and and you know we have other

    "transcript": "[doctor] Good morning, Nathan. How have you been feeling since our last visit?\n[patient] Hi, doctor. Well, I've been managing okay, but I've had some challenges with my blood sugar levels. They've been a bit erratic.\n[doctor] I see. Could you tell me more about your current routine with your medications? Are you still taking Gliclazide and Metformin?\n[patient] Yes, I'm on Gliclazide 30 mg once daily and Metformin 500 mg twice a day. I try to take them with my meals, but sometimes my schedule gets in the way.\n[doctor] Consistency is key with those medications, Nathan. It's important to try and take them at the same time each day to maintain stable blood sugar levels. How about your diet and exercise regimen?\n[patient] I've been trying to stick to a low-carb diet, and I walk my dog every morning. I was doing well for a while, but I've had some slip-ups with my diet recently.\n[doctor] Understandable, it can be tough to maintain dietary changes. Let's talk about those slip-ups and see how we can better manage them. Now, have you noticed any side effects from the Gliclazide or Metformin?\n[patient] Not really, no. I mean, I've had a bit of stomach upset with the Metformin at the start, but that's settled now.\n[doctor] That's good to hear. It's not uncommon for Metformin to cause gastrointestinal symptoms. It's encouraging that your body has adjusted. How about hypoglycemic episodes? Any dizziness or feeling shaky?\n[patient] Once or twice, actually. I had a few dizzy spells when I missed a meal after taking Gliclazide.\n[doctor] That's a concern. Remember, Gliclazide stimulates your pancreas to release more insulin, which can cause low blood sugar, especially if you haven't eaten. It's crucial to align your medication with your meals to avoid hypoglycemia. Have you been monitoring your blood glucose levels at home?\n[patient] I have, but not as regularly as I should. Sometimes it's in the normal range, other times it's a bit high.\n[doctor] Regular monitoring is important, Nathan. It helps us track the effectiveness of your medication and make necessary adjustments. We might need to discuss your dosing or even consider additional medication if your levels remain high. How about your water intake? Are you staying hydrated?\n[patient] I think I'm doing okay with water. I don't keep track, but I always carry a bottle with me.\n[doctor] Good, staying hydrated is essential, especially when taking Metformin, as it helps to prevent dehydration and supports kidney function. Now, let's discuss your lifestyle a bit more. How's work and stress levels?\n[patient] Work has been pretty demanding lately, and the stress doesn't help with my diet and exercise. I tend to eat more when I'm stressed.\n[doctor] Stress can definitely impact your diabetes management. Have you tried any stress-reduction techniques, like deep breathing exercises or mindfulness meditation?\n[patient] Not really, I haven\u2019t had much time to explore that.\n[doctor] It might be something worth looking into. Managing stress can have a positive effect on your overall health and can help with your diabetes control. Let's also talk about your support system. Do you have family or friends to help you with your diabetes management?\n[patient] My family is supportive, but they have their own things to worry about. I don't want to burden them too much.\n[doctor] It's important to remember that you're not a burden, Nathan. Having a support system can be very beneficial, and they can help keep you accountable and motivated. Now, let's check your vitals and do a brief physical examination. Is there anything else you'd like to discuss before we proceed?\n[patient] I've been experiencing some tingling in my feet. Is that something to worry about?\n[doctor] Tingling in your feet can be a sign of neuropathy, which can be related to diabetes. We'll definitely want to examine that today and potentially order some tests to evaluate it further. Let's continue with the examination, and then we can discuss a comprehensive plan for you.\n\n[The doctor performs a thorough physical examination, checking Nathan's vitals, feet, and overall condition.]\n\n[doctor] Nathan, your blood pressure is slightly elevated today, which could be due to stress or other factors. Your foot examination shows some reduced sensation, which is consistent with diabetic neuropathy. We'll need to keep an eye on that and manage your blood sugar levels more aggressively to prevent further complications. Now, let's talk about a plan moving forward.\n\nFirstly, I want you to focus on taking your medications, Gliclazide and Metformin, consistently as prescribed. Let's try setting alarms or reminders to help with this. Secondly, we need to stabilize your diet. If you're struggling, I can refer you to a dietician who specializes in diabetes management.\n\nNext, let's increase your home blood glucose monitoring. I'd like you to check your levels at least twice a day, in the morning and before dinner, and record the results. This will help us to identify patterns and adjust your treatment as needed.\n\nRegarding the tingling in your feet, we'll order some tests to assess the extent of the neuropathy. Based on the results, we may need to consider additional medications or therapies. I also want to emphasize the importance of good foot care. Make sure to check your feet daily for any cuts, blisters, or changes.\n\nLastly, we should address your stress levels. I'm going to provide you with some resources for stress management techniques. It could be beneficial to incorporate activities like yoga or meditation into your routine. And don't hesitate to lean on your family for support; they can be a great asset in your diabetes management.\n\nDo you have any questions or concerns about this plan, Nathan?\n[patient] No, that all sounds manageable. I appreciate the guidance.\n[doctor] Excellent. We'll schedule a follow-up appointment in three months to reassess your progress. If you encounter any issues or have concerns before then, please don't hesitate to contact the office. And remember, Nathan, taking care of your diabetes is a team effort. We're here to support you every step of the way.\n\n[patient] Thank you, doctor. I'll work on those changes and keep track of everything.\n[doctor] You're welcome, Nathan. Keep up the good work, and congratulations on taking these steps towards better health. I'll see you in three months, or sooner if needed. Take care.\n\n[patient] Thanks again. Take care, doctor.\n\n[doctor] Goodbye, Nathan.\n\n[patient] Goodbye.",

    "transcript": "[doctor] Good morning, Harper. How have you been feeling since our last visit?\n[patient] Hi Doctor, I\u2019ve had some good days and some not-so-good ones. It\u2019s been a bit of a roller coaster.\n[doctor] I see. I want to ensure we cover all the bases today. Let\u2019s start with your current medications. You're on Memantine and Donepezil; can you confirm the dosages for me?\n[patient] Sure, I\u2019m taking 10 mg of Memantine twice a day, and the Donepezil is 5 mg once daily at night.\n[doctor] That\u2019s correct. And how are you managing with those? Any side effects or concerns?\n[patient] The Memantine seems okay, but the Donepezil makes me a bit nauseous sometimes.\n[doctor] Nausea is a known side effect of Donepezil. We can discuss ways to manage that. But first, tell me about the not-so-good days you mentioned.\n[patient] Well, there are days when I feel more confused than usual, and my memory seems to slip more. I also get this headache that doesn\u2019t go away easily.\n[doctor] I'm sorry to hear that, Harper. Memory issues can be very challenging. We'll review your treatment plan to see if adjustments are necessary. Now, any changes in your daily activities or routines?\n[patient] I\u2019ve been less active, I guess. I feel tired more often, and I don\u2019t have the energy to go for walks like I used to.\n[doctor] Fatigue can affect your overall well-being. It\u2019s important we address that. Have you had any changes in your appetite or weight recently?\n[patient] My appetite is not great. I\u2019ve lost a few pounds over the last month without trying.\n[doctor] Unintentional weight loss needs to be investigated. We\u2019ll look into that today. Any other symptoms, like shortness of breath, chest pain, or palpitations?\n[patient] No chest pains or palpitations, but I do get short of breath when I try to do anything a bit strenuous.\n[doctor] Noted. How about your mood? Any feelings of sadness, anxiety, or depression?\n[patient] Yeah, I\u2019ve been feeling down. It\u2019s hard not to when you can\u2019t do the things you enjoy.\n[doctor] It\u2019s completely understandable, Harper. We can explore some support options for you. Now, let\u2019s move on to a physical exam, and then we\u2019ll look at your recent labs. Do you consent to the physical exam?\n[patient] Yes, that\u2019s fine.\n[doctor] Great. Let's start with your vitals. [Doctor checks vital signs] Blood pressure and heart rate are within normal ranges. I\u2019m going to listen to your heart and lungs now. [Doctor performs auscultation] Heart and lung sounds are clear. No murmurs or wheezing.\n[patient] That's good to hear.\n[doctor] Yes, it is. I\u2019m going to check your reflexes and motor strength next. [Doctor conducts neurological exam] Your reflexes are symmetrical, and motor strength is consistent with previous exams. I do want to check for any signs of edema in your lower extremities. [Doctor inspects legs] No significant swelling, that\u2019s good.\n[patient] I\u2019ve been trying to keep my legs elevated when I sit.\n[doctor] That\u2019s a good practice, Harper. Now, let's review your lab results. [Doctor pulls up lab results on the computer] Your kidney function is stable, and liver enzymes look normal. However, your thyroid-stimulating hormone is a bit elevated. Have you noticed any symptoms that could be related to your thyroid, like changes in your skin or hair, constipation, or feeling cold?\n[patient] Not really, but I guess I have been feeling colder than usual.\n[doctor] That could be related to thyroid function. We\u2019ll do a full thyroid panel to get more information. Now, regarding your memory concerns, given that you\u2019re on Memantine and Donepezil, which help manage symptoms of Alzheimer's, we should consider a follow-up with your neurologist. How does that sound?\n[patient] Sounds good. I want to do whatever can help.\n[doctor] Excellent. I\u2019ll make a referral and we\u2019ll get you an appointment. Now, about the nausea with Donepezil, you could try taking it with a light snack or switch to taking it in the morning. Sometimes that helps. If it doesn\u2019t improve, we might need to adjust the dosage or look at alternative treatments.\n[patient] I\u2019ll try taking it in the morning and see if that helps with the nausea.\n[doctor] Great. Let\u2019s also talk about your mood. It's very important to address mental health, especially when dealing with a chronic condition. Would you be open to speaking with a counselor or therapist?\n[patient] I think I would. Maybe it would help.\n[doctor] I believe it would. I\u2019ll provide you with some recommendations. It\u2019s also important to engage in activities that can help with mood, such as light exercise, hobbies, or social interactions. Can we explore some options for you?\n[patient] I used to enjoy gardening. Maybe I could start with that again.\n[doctor] Gardening is an excellent choice. It's therapeutic and can be quite enjoyable. Let's make sure you have the support to do it safely. Now, I want to ensure we\u2019re managing your fatigue effectively. Are you sleeping well at night?\n[patient] Not the best. I wake up a lot and have trouble falling back asleep.\n[doctor] Sleep disturbances can contribute to fatigue and cognitive issues. We need to focus on improving your sleep hygiene. Avoid caffeine in the evening, keep a regular sleep schedule, and make your bedroom a comfortable, sleep-conducive environment.\n[patient] I'll work on that. Any other suggestions?\n[doctor] Yes, if those adjustments don't help, we can consider a sleep study to rule out any sleep disorders. But let's start with these changes first. Now, I'd like to discuss your support system at home. Do you have family or friends who can help you with daily tasks or accompany you to appointments?\n[patient] My daughter, she\u2019s been a big help. She comes over a few times a week.\n[doctor] That\u2019s wonderful to hear. It\u2019s important to have a good support network. We can also look into home health services if you feel you need additional assistance.\n[patient] That might be good to have as an option.\n[doctor] Definitely. We\u2019ll get some information for you before you leave today. Before we conclude, do you have any questions or concerns that we haven't addressed?\n[patient] Not that I can think of right now. You\u2019ve been very thorough.\n[doctor] I'm glad to hear that. Remember, you can always reach out to our office if you have questions later on. I\u2019ll summarize our plan: we\u2019ll adjust the timing of your Donepezil, refer you to a neurologist, order a thyroid panel, provide mental health support resources, and focus on improving your sleep and activity levels. I\u2019ll also get you information on home health services.\n[patient] That sounds like a plan. Thank you, Doctor.\n[doctor] Of course, Harper. I\u2019ll see you back here in a month to follow up unless something comes up before then. In the meantime, take care, and my team will assist you with the referrals and information you need. Let\u2019s finalize your visit notes. [Doctor completes the medical record] Take care, Harper, and we'll see you soon.\n[patient] Thanks again, Doctor. See you next time.",

    "transcript": "[doctor] Good morning, Ella. How have you been feeling since your last visit?\n[patient] Hi, Doctor. I've been okay, but I've had some ongoing issues that I wanted to discuss with you today.\n\n[doctor] Of course, Ella. Let's go over some details. I see on your chart that you're currently taking Tadalafil and Finasteride. Can you confirm the dosages for me?\n[patient] Yes, I'm taking 5 mg of Tadalafil daily, and 1 mg of Finasteride every day as well.\n\n[doctor] Great, thank you for confirming. Are you experiencing any side effects from these medications?\n[patient] I think I've been feeling a bit more tired than usual, and I've noticed a decrease in my libido, which is a bit concerning.\n\n[doctor] Those can be side effects associated with these medications. We'll monitor that closely. Now, tell me more about the issues you wanted to discuss.\n[patient] Well, I've been having some trouble with my breathing lately. It's like I can't catch my breath after doing simple tasks.\n\n[doctor] I see. How long has this been going on?\n[patient] It's been a few weeks now.\n\n[doctor] Have you noticed any patterns or triggers that seem to make it worse?\n[patient] Not particularly. It seems to happen randomly, but maybe a bit more often when I'm active.\n\n[doctor] Do you have any history of asthma or respiratory issues in your family?\n[patient] Not that I'm aware of, no.\n\n[doctor] Alright, we'll investigate that further. Have you experienced any chest pain or tightness along with the shortness of breath?\n[patient] No chest pain, just the tightness and shortness of breath.\n\n[doctor] Okay. Let's check your vital signs. The nurse recorded your blood pressure as 120 over 80, which is good. Your heart rate is a bit elevated at the moment, 92 beats per minute. We'll also need to check your oxygen saturation and listen to your lungs. Please take a deep breath for me. [listening with stethoscope] Your lungs sound clear, and your oxygen saturation is at 98%, which is within the normal range.\n\n[patient] That's good to hear.\n\n[doctor] Yes, it is. Now onto the breathing issue. We'll do a few more tests to rule out any underlying conditions. It could be an effect of stress, or perhaps an undiagnosed mild form of asthma. We'll also consider the possibility of the medications affecting your cardiovascular system.\n\n[patient] Okay, I understand.\n\n[doctor] Moving forward, can you tell me how you're managing with the Finasteride? Any concerns with hair loss or other symptoms you're taking it for?\n[patient] The hair loss seems to have slowed down, which is good. But I'm worried about the other side effects I mentioned earlier.\n\n[doctor] Understandable, Ella. The sexual side effects can be concerning. We'll need to consider if the benefits outweigh these side effects for you. If necessary, there are alternative treatments we can explore.\n\n[patient] I appreciate that. I was also wondering if there might be any interactions between Tadalafil and Finasteride?\n[doctor] Typically, Tadalafil and Finasteride can be taken together without significant interactions, as they work differently in the body. However, everyone's response can vary, so we'll keep a close eye on how you're feeling with both medications.\n\n[patient] That's reassuring. Is there anything I should be doing differently in terms of diet or exercise that might help with these issues?\n[doctor] A balanced diet and regular exercise can certainly help with overall health and may improve some of the symptoms you're experiencing. We also want to make sure you stay well-hydrated and limit caffeine and alcohol, as they can sometimes exacerbate symptoms of breathlessness and fatigue.\n\n[patient] I can do that. I'll make sure to watch my diet and keep up with my exercise routine.\n\n[doctor] Excellent. Now, I'm going to prescribe a short course of a bronchodilator to use when you're experiencing significant shortness of breath. This can help open up your airways and make breathing easier. We'll also schedule pulmonary function tests to get a better idea of what's going on with your respiratory system. \n\n[patient] Okay, that sounds good. How often should I use the bronchodilator?\n\n[doctor] Use it only as needed for now, and we'll reevaluate its use when you come back for your follow-up. If you find you're using it frequently, please let me know.\n\n[patient] Will do. And when should I come back for the follow-up?\n\n[doctor] Let's schedule it for four weeks from now. However, if your symptoms worsen or you have any concerns before then, don't hesitate to contact the office and we'll see you sooner.\n\n[patient] Alright, I'll make sure to do that. Thank you for addressing all my concerns today.\n\n[doctor] You're very welcome, Ella. It's important that we keep track of how you're doing on these medications and address any new symptoms that arise. My nurse will provide you with the prescription and instructions for the bronchodilator, as well as the appointment slip for your follow-up and pulmonary tests.\n\n[patient] Thank you, Doctor. I feel better knowing we have a plan.\n\n[doctor] It's my pleasure. Take care, Ella, and we\u2019ll see you soon. If anything comes up or you have questions, just give us a call.\n\n[patient] I will. Have a great day.\n\n[doctor] You too, Ella. Goodbye for now.\n\n[patient] Goodbye, Doctor.",

millimeter lesion which was located on right inferior back . pathology came back as melanoma .\n[doctor] mrs. jackson , it's good to meet you .\n[patient] likewise , wish it were under better circumstances .\n[doctor] yeah , i hear your dermatologist sent you to me 'cause she found a melanoma ?\n[patient] yes , that's what the biopsy said .\n[doctor] okay and when did you first notice the spot ?\n[patient] my mom noticed it when i was visiting her last month .\n[doctor] i see . and so you went to the dermatologist on april 10th to get it checked out , right ?\n[patient] yes , i wanted to be extra cautious because skin cancer does run in my family .\n[doctor] well i'm really glad you took it seriously and got it checked . who in your family has had skin cancer , and do you know if it was melanoma or was it basal cell or squamous cell ?\n[patient] my mom and her sister , i think they both had melanoma .\n[doctor] okay . do you have any other types of cancer in the family , like breast or ovarian ?\n[patient] my grandfather had pancreatic cancer .\n[doctor] okay , and was that your mom or dad's father ?\n[patient] mother's .\n[doctor] okay . and , um , have you personally had any skin spots in the past that you got checked out and they were cancerous or precancerous ?\n[patient] no , this was the first time i've been to a dermatologist . um , but my primary care doctor looks over all of my moles every year at my physical and has n't said , um , he's concerned about any of 'em before .\n[doctor] good- good . uh , let's go over your medical history from your chart . i have that you're not taking any medications and do n't have any health problems listed , but that you're allergic to augmentin , is that right ?\n[patient] yes , that's correct .\n[doctor] okay , and for social history can you tell me what you do for work ?\n[patient] i own an auto repair shop .\n[doctor] okay and have you ever been a smoker ?\n[patient] yeah , i still smoke from time to time . i started that awful habit in my teens and it's hard to break , but i'm trying .\n[doctor] i'm glad you're trying to quit . uh , what about your surgical history , have you had any surgeries ?\n[patient] i had gall bladder and appendix .\n[doctor] okay , great , we can get your chart up to date now , thank you . and other than the melanoma , how has your health been , any unintentional weight changes , headaches , fatigue , nausea , vomiting , vision changes ?\n[patient] no , i've been feelin' great .\n[doctor] good . well let me take a look at your back here where they did the biopsy if you do n't mind .\n[patient] sure .\n[doctor] okay , i'm gon na describe it in medical jargon what i'm seeing here , so that the recording can capture it , but you and i are gon na go over it together in just a moment , okay ?\n[patient] okay , that's fine .\n[doctor] all right , so on the right inferior back there's a one centimeter shave biopsy site , including all of the dermis with no residual pigmentation . there's no intrinsic or satellite lesions , no other suspicious moles , no axillary , cervical , or supraclavicular lymphadenopathy . there is a soft lymph node in the right groin , but it's nontender , otherwise normal exam .\n[doctor] okay , you can sit up . um , so what i was saying there is that i see your biopsy site , but i do n't see any other s- , um , skin lumps or bumps that look suspicious . uh , i also felt your lymph nodes to see if any of them felt abnormal . there is one in the right groin that felt slightly abnormal . it's very likely nothing , but i do want you to have an ultrasound of that area to confirm it's nothing , um , and , you know , make sure it's nothing that we need to worry about . uh , the reason we're being extra cautious is that melanoma can very rarely metastasize to the lymph nodes . the ultrasound can tell us if we need to look into this further .\n[patient] okay , i should n't worry too much then ?\n[doctor] no , i have a low suspicion that it will show anything .\n[patient] okay , good .\n[doctor] so assuming that the ultrasound is normal , the treatment for you melanoma is to cut out the area where the lesion was . with lesions that are 0.7 millimeters or less , um , and that's what we recommend , and yours was exactly 0.7 millimeters . if it were any bigger , we would have had to do a more complex surgery . but what i recommend for you is what we call a wide local incision , excuse me , excision , meaning that i will make a long incision and then cut out an area a bit wider than your current biopsy site . the incision is long because that's what allows me to close the skin nicely . you'll have a fairly long scar from the incision .\n[patient] okay , that is fine with me , i ca n't see back there anyways .\n[doctor] yeah , your wife can tell you what it looks like and she may need to help care for the incision at it , as it heals . um , but since we're , we are n't doing the more complex surgery , i actually do n't need to see you back unless you want to check in with me or have any problems . however , it is very important that you continue to follow up with your dermatologist regularly so she can monitor you . uh , your dermatologist will check that this one does n't come back , but she'll also check for other lesions that look suspicious . uh , unfortunately , since you've had one melanoma , you're at a higher risk of developing another one somewhere else .\n[patient] yeah , she did say she wants to see me back .\n[doctor] good , and i'm sure she's already told you , but it's very important that you apply sunscreen anytime and anywhere that your skin is exposed to sunlight .\n[patient] yeah , she definitely went over that , um , several times with me .\n[doctor] good . other than that , i think that's all for me . um , we'll get you set up for the ultrasound , the procedure . do you have any questions for me ?\n[patient] um , no i ca n't think of any at this time .\n[doctor] okay , my nurse will be in to get you scheduled , so sit tight . it was very good to meet you .\n[patient] thank you , nice to meet you as well .\n[doctor] please add the following pathology r- , to results . a pathology , shave of right inferior back , malignant melanoma , invasive , superficial spreading . histology , superficial spreading . clark level 4 , breslow thickness 0.7 millimeters , radial growth phase present , vertical growth phase not identified . mitotic features , less than one millimeter squared . ulceration not identified , progression not identified , lymphatic invasion not identified , perineural invasion not identified , microscopic satellitosis not identified . infiltrating , uh , lymphocytes , breast . um , melanocytic nevus not identified . predominant cytology epithelioid , peripheral margin positive , deep margin , uh , negative , stage 1 . also note that i reviewed the dermatologist's photo of the lesion which showed an asymmetric black and brown nevus with central a melanotic component and irregular border .\n[doctor] for assessment and plan , the patient presents today with newly diagnosed melanoma . biopsy revealed an intermediate thickness melanoma . on examination today , there is right inguinal lymph node with slightly atypical consistency . i recommended an ultrasound to rule out metastatic disease . if the ultrasound is normal , the patient is a candidate for wide local excision with a one to two centimeter margin .\n[doctor] primary closure should be possible , but skin graft closure may be needed . the relationship between tumor histology and prognosis and treatment was carefully reviewed . the need for follow-up , according to the national comprehensive cancer network guidelines , was reviewed . we also reviewed the principles of sun avoidance , skin self-examination , and the abcdes of mole surveillance .\n[doctor] after discussing the procedure , risk and expected outcomes , and

    "transcript": "[doctor] Good morning, we have our next patient, Oliver Harris, MRN 856943. Mr. Harris is a 63-year-old male presenting for a follow-up on his hypertension and cholesterol management. According to our records, he's currently on Atorvastatin, 20mg daily.\n\n[doctor] Mr. Harris, it's nice to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last visit?\n\n[patient] Good morning, Doctor. I've been feeling pretty well, all things considered.\n\n[doctor] That's good to hear. Are you still taking the Atorvastatin as prescribed?\n\n[patient] Yes, I take the 20mg pill every evening with my dinner.\n\n[doctor] Excellent. Have you noticed any side effects or issues since starting the medication?\n\n[patient] Not really. Sometimes I feel a bit tired, but I'm not sure if it's the medication or just my busy schedule.\n\n[doctor] Fatigue can be a side effect, but it's also common with a busy lifestyle. We'll monitor that. Have you had any muscle pain or weakness, which can be a rare side effect of the medication?\n\n[patient] Now that you mention it, I've had some mild cramps in my legs at night. Nothing too severe, though.\n\n[doctor] Okay, let's keep an eye on that. Muscle cramps may be a sign of a more serious side effect. We might consider a creatine kinase test to rule out muscle damage if the cramps persist or worsen. Now, how about your diet and exercise? Are you managing to keep active and eat healthily?\n\n[patient] I've been trying to. I go for walks most evenings, and I've cut back on fatty foods.\n\n[doctor] That's fantastic. Exercise and diet play a crucial role in managing cholesterol levels and heart health. Now, tell me, have you had any chest pains, shortness of breath, or episodes of dizziness?\n\n[patient] No, nothing like that.\n\n[doctor] Great. Do you have any other health concerns today that you'd like to discuss?\n\n[patient] Well, I've been having some trouble sleeping lately. I'm not sure if it's stress or something else.\n\n[doctor] Insomnia can be multifactorial. We can discuss strategies for better sleep hygiene and, if necessary, consider whether a mild sleep aid might be appropriate for you. Let's also talk about your stress levels. What seems to be causing you the most stress recently?\n\n[patient] Work has been very hectic, and I'm worried about my retirement plans.\n\n[doctor] It's normal to feel anxious about major life changes like retirement. Have you considered speaking with a financial adviser or a counselor to help you through this transition?\n\n[patient] I have, actually. I've got an appointment next week.\n\n[doctor] Good. It's important to address both physical and mental health. Now, regarding your blood pressure, how have your readings been at home?\n\n[patient] They've been mostly within the range you told me to watch for, but there have been a few higher readings on particularly stressful days.\n\n[doctor] That's to be expected. Stress can elevate blood pressure temporarily. Try to use relaxation techniques on those days. Now, let's check your blood pressure today.\n\n[patient] Sure, go ahead.\n\n[doctor] [After checking blood pressure] Your reading is within the normal range today, which is excellent. It seems like the management plan is working well for you. Let's also do a blood test today to check your cholesterol levels and make sure the Atorvastatin is effectively managing your LDL levels. When was the last time you had a blood test?\n\n[patient] I believe it was about six months ago, right before I started taking the Atorvastatin.\n\n[doctor] Perfect, so it's time for another one to see the progress. We'll also check your liver function as Atorvastatin can affect liver enzymes. I'd like you to continue monitoring your blood pressure at home. Keep a log and bring it to your next appointment.\n\n[patient] Will do. Should I be doing anything else in the meantime?\n\n[doctor] Continue your exercise routine, maintain a heart-healthy diet, and manage stress as best as you can. Also, keep taking the Atorvastatin 20mg daily, and let's schedule a follow-up in three months to review your lab results and reassess your treatment plan. Unless, of course, you have any concerns before then, in which case, please don't hesitate to contact us.\n\n[patient] Sounds good. I'll keep everything up and see you in three months or sooner if something comes up.\n\n[doctor] Excellent, Mr. Harris. Before you go, do you have any questions or other issues you'd like to address?\n\n[patient] No, I think we've covered everything. I appreciate your help, Doctor.\n\n[doctor] It's my pleasure. Remember, we're here to support you, not just with your physical health but with your overall well-being. Don't hesitate to reach out if you need to. Our nurse will come in shortly to draw blood for your tests and to schedule your next appointment. Take care, Mr. Harris, and I'll see you soon.\n\n[patient] Thank you, Doctor. I'll see you next time.\n\n[doctor] [To the recorder] Please note that patient Oliver Harris, MRN 856943, is to continue on Atorvastatin, 20mg daily for cholesterol management. We've discussed the importance of lifestyle modifications including diet and exercise. Blood pressure is stable, and we will be conducting a blood test today to check cholesterol levels and liver function. Follow-up appointment is scheduled for three months from now, or sooner if the patient experiences any concerning symptoms. This concludes today's consultation.",

    "example_transcript": "[doctor] so anna good to see you today so reading here in your appointment notes you were you were diagnosed with kidney stones from your your pcp and you currently have one and so they they had you come in so can you tell me what happened how's all that going for you\n[patient] sure i've been having some back pain on my right side it's been lasting for about a week now\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] and i also started to see some blood in my urine\n[doctor] okay so on the right side so does that pain does it move anywhere or is it just kinda stay in that that one area\n[patient] yeah it's moved down a little bit on to my right lower side a little bit\n[doctor] side okay so how would you describe the pain is it constant or is does it come and go\n[patient] it's pretty constant\n[doctor] okay did you notice any pain when you're urinating i know i know you say you you saw you see blood but any pain with that\n[patient] no no real pain when i'm when i'm peeing at all\n[doctor] okay so have you taken anything i know have you tried like azo or any of that to\n[patient] i took some ibuprofen that helped a little bit\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] but it still hurts even with ibuprofen\n[doctor] alright have you noticed any nausea vomiting fever chills\n[patient] i have n't thrown up but i felt a little bit nauseated\n[doctor] little nauseated yeah that's we expected so have you do you have a family history of kidney stones i know some people when they have them like their parents have them stuff but\n[patient] yeah my my dad had kidney stones i think he has passed a couple of them i'm not quite sure\n[doctor] alright and have you had any in the past or is this your first one\n[patient] this is my first time i've never had this before\n[doctor] okay alright so we'll do we'll do an exam on you just to check you out so i guess you were in pain and stuff over the over the easter easter break there that\n[patient] yeah yeah i had some pain over the weekend i saw my pediatrician this morning so they sent me over here they were concerned that i might have a kidney stone\n[doctor] okay so i'm guessing you did n't get to go find the eggs on the easter egg hunt because of the you were in pain\n[patient] not so much but i i got to participate a little bit i opened some eggs i just did n't go run around and find them\n[doctor] okay well i i'm lucky enough my friends had an adult easter hag hunt for me and so i was able to find a couple eggs yesterday myself so i i'm glad you were able to get a few of them alright so let's do that that physical exam on you so your vitals look good you do n't have any fever your blood pressure heart rate is fine so when i press here on your belly does that hurt\n[patient] a little bit yeah\n[doctor] a little bit alright so on your exam of your abdomen there is mild pain and tenderness to palpation of the abdomen there's no rebound or guarding there is cva located near your flank tenderness on the right so that means that everything looks good but you do have what seems to be some inflammation of your kidney okay so we we were able to get a ct of your your side and it showed that you do have a stone measuring point five centimeters in size and it's located in the proximal right ureter and so that's that duck that passes from your kidney to your bladder alright i do n't see any evidence of hydronephrosis so that means that there's not obstructing ureter causing swelling in your kidney which is which is pretty good so let's talk a little bit about my assessment and plan so you do have that kidney stone on the right so what i'm recommending is i want you to push fluids just to help facilitate you passing that stone alright have you been taking in have you been drinking enough water do you think so far\n[patient] probably not enough i drink some but\n[doctor] okay yeah i i want you to to drink try drink as much as possible just to see if we can get you hydrated and pass the stone what i'm gon na do is i'm gon na prescribe you ibuprofen eight hundred milligrams you can take that as needed for pain i know you said you were in that much pain just in case it does start to move you're in pain i want you to take the ibuprofen i'm also gon na give you a strainer for you to strain your pee so we can see you wan na know when that that stone does pass gon na order a bmp and a urinalysis and a urine culture and based on what the urinalysis shows we can decide if i can decide if i need to put you on antibiotics if you do have an infection of some kind and i wan na see you back in about a week to two weeks and if you're still having symptoms we can discuss further treatment such as a lithotripsy and it's it's a mainly minimally invasive procedure where we use shock waves to try to break up that stone but otherwise do you have any other questions for me\n[patient] no i do n't think so\n[doctor] alright so we will see you back in a week or two and i'll have my nurse come in with that prescription and hopefully with all the treatment you'll be able to pass the stone okay alright",
    "transcript": "[doctor] Good morning, Isaac. It's nice to have you back in the clinic. I see from your chart that you're currently on Montelukast. Can you remind me of the dosage you're taking for that?\n\n[patient] Good morning, Doctor. Yeah, I'm taking 10 mg of Montelukast daily.\n\n[doctor] Perfect, and how's that been working out for you? Any issues or side effects?\n\n[patient] I think it's been okay. I haven't noticed any major side effects. It seems to help with my allergies.\n\n[doctor] That's good to hear. So, what brings you in today, Isaac?\n\n[patient] Well, over the past couple of weeks, I've been feeling really tired. I thought it might just be the change in seasons, but I'm starting to get a little concerned because it doesn't seem to be getting better.\n\n[doctor] I see. Has there been any change in your sleep patterns or daily routine that you think might be contributing to your fatigue?\n\n[patient] Not really. I've been trying to go to bed at the same time every night, and I get about seven hours of sleep, but I still wake up feeling exhausted.\n\n[doctor] Understood. Any other symptoms? Muscle pain, headaches, or perhaps issues with concentration?\n\n[patient] Now that you mention it, I've had some headaches on and off. I just chalked it up to stress at work, but maybe it's related?\n\n[doctor] It's possible. Stress can definitely impact your overall health. How about your diet? Have you been eating regularly and staying hydrated?\n\n[patient] Yeah, I eat three meals a day and I've been trying to drink more water. Although, I guess I do have coffee in the morning and sometimes after lunch.\n\n[doctor] Okay. Caffeine can sometimes affect your sleep quality. Try to limit your intake, especially in the afternoon. Now, let's check a few things. I'm going to take your blood pressure and listen to your heart and lungs.\n\n[patient] Sounds good.\n\n[doctor] Your blood pressure looks normal, and your heart and lungs sound clear. I would like to run some blood tests to check your thyroid function, vitamin levels, and look for any signs of anemia or other potential issues that could be causing your fatigue. It's also important to rule out any infections.\n\n[patient] Sure, that makes sense. I just want to figure out what's going on so I can get back to feeling normal.\n\n[doctor] Of course. Besides the fatigue and headaches, have you noticed any changes in your mood or weight recently?\n\n[patient] I haven't really been in the mood to do much, and I think I've lost a little weight without trying. I guess I've been a bit down because of how tired I've been feeling.\n\n[doctor] Okay, those are important details. Weight loss and changes in mood can be linked with several conditions, so we'll take that into account. Now, regarding your Montelukast, you haven't felt that it's been less effective for your allergies, have you?\n\n[patient] No, it seems to be doing its job with the allergies. I haven't had any issues there.\n\n[doctor] Alright, that's good to know. We'll keep you on the Montelukast then. I'm also going to recommend that you start a symptom diary. Note down your energy levels throughout the day, your sleep quality, what you eat, and when you experience headaches or other symptoms. It can help us identify patterns or triggers.\n\n[patient] I can do that. Should I track anything else?\n\n[doctor] If you notice anything out of the ordinary, jot it down, even if it seems minor. Now, let's talk about your mental health. The stress you've mentioned, along with fatigue, can sometimes be indicative of depression or anxiety. How have you been coping with stress?\n\n[patient] I try to manage. I've been doing some reading in the evenings to relax, and I take walks when I can.\n\n[doctor] Those are good strategies. Exercise can be very beneficial, so try to include some physical activity in your routine, even if it's just a short walk each day. If you're open to it, I can also refer you to a counselor who can provide additional support.\n\n[patient] I'll consider it. I haven't thought much about counseling, but maybe it could help.\n\n[doctor] It's worth exploring, especially if you're feeling down. Now, once we get the results from your blood tests, we'll have a better idea of what might be causing your symptoms. Depending on the findings, we may need to adjust your treatment plan or explore other medications to address any deficiencies or imbalances.\n\n[patient] Alright. How soon do you think we'll have the results?\n\n[doctor] Typically, it takes a few days for all the results to come back. I'll give you a call as soon as I have all the information. In the meantime, focus on getting rest, staying hydrated, and try to reduce your caffeine intake.\n\n[patient] Okay. And if I start feeling worse?\n\n[doctor] If your symptoms worsen or if you have any new concerns, don't hesitate to contact the office. We're here to help you.\n\n[patient] Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate it.\n\n[doctor] Absolutely, Isaac. Taking care of your health is our top priority. Let's schedule a follow-up appointment for two weeks from now, but if you need anything before then, please reach out. I'll have the nurse come in with the paperwork for the blood tests, and we can go from there.\n\n[patient] Sounds good. Thank you for your help today.\n\n[doctor] You're welcome. Take care, Isaac, and I'll speak to you soon.\n\n[patient] Bye, Doctor.\n\n[doctor] Goodbye, Isaac.\n\n(Note: This synthetic transcript is for illustrative purposes and does not represent real patient information or medical advice.)",
