CHIEF COMPLAINT

Right ankle pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Carolyn Jones is a pleasant 38-year-old female who presents to the clinic today for evaluation of right ankle pain.

The patient sustained an injury to her right ankle when she slipped and fell on ice while taking her garbage out yesterday. This was her first right ankle injury. She believes she heard a pop at the time, but denies any associated numbness or tingling. Initially, she was unable to bear weight on the ankle and required help getting inside; however, she is now able to slightly bear weight but ambulates with an antalgic gait. Ice, elevation, and ibuprofen have been helpful at reducing her pain. She rates her current pain as 4/10, her pain without medication as 6/10, and her pain with medication as 1/10.

Of note, the patient participates in an intramural soccer league but has not been able to play since this injury.

MEDICAL HISTORY

The patient reports that she has had several ankle injuries in the past. This is her first right ankle injury.

SOCIAL HISTORY

The patient reports that she has a history of playing sports. She played soccer in college and is now in an intramural soccer league.

MEDICATIONS

The patient reports that she has been taking ibuprofen.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Musculoskeletal: Reports right ankle pain.
Neurological: Denies right ankle numbness or tingling.

VITALS

Normal

PHYSICAL EXAM

GAIT: antalgic gait
CV: Brisk capillary refill to less than 3 seconds. Strong dorsalis pedis pulse.
NEURO: Sensation in the right ankle is intact to light touch distally.
MSK: Examination of the right ankle: Ecchymosis over the lateral malleolus associated with trace edema in that area. Tenderness to palpation over the anterolateral soft tissue. No laxity on anterior drawer testing or inversion stress testing. No bony tenderness on palpation of the foot or ankle area. Findings are consistent bilaterally.

RESULTS

X-ray images of the right ankle were obtained and reviewed today. These reveal no evidence of fracture.

ASSESSMENT

Lateral ligament complex sprain, Right ankle.

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, her symptoms are consistent with a right ankle sprain of the lateral ligament complex, more specifically the anterior talofibular ligament. We had a lengthy discussion regarding the nature of this injury and the course of treatment. I advised her to keep her leg elevated when she is seated and continue to ice her ankle. She should also continue taking ibuprofen as-needed for pain and inflammation management. She will be placed in an Aircast to help stabilize her ankle, and I am going to order crutches so she can remain non-weight-bearing for the next couple of days. At that point, she can start bearing weight on the ankle as tolerated.

INSTRUCTIONS

The patient will follow up in 2 weeks.

Chief Complaint: Right knee pain
Secondary Complaints: diabetes

MEDICAL NOTE:

CHIEF COMPLAINT

Right knee pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Virginia Phillips is a pleasant 53-year-old female who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of right knee pain. The onset of her pain began 7 days ago, when she was playing basketball and another player ran into her. She states that she fell to the ground and landed on her side. She denies hearing or feeling a pop at the time of the injury. The patient localizes her pain to the medial aspect of her knee. She used ice and an ACE wrap right after the injury. Today, she notes that she has been doing exercises, ice, and Mobic for pain control.

MEDICAL HISTORY

The patient reports she is a diabetic who takes her blood sugar every morning.

SOCIAL HISTORY

Patient reports that she plays basketball at the Y for fun.

MEDICATIONS

Patient reports that she takes metformin 500 mg twice a day.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Musculoskeletal: Reports right knee pain.

PHYSICAL EXAM

MSK: Examination of the right knee: No pain to palpation of the lateral aspect of the right knee. Pain with palpation on the medial aspect of the knee. Ecchymosis and swelling on the medial aspect of the knee. Effusion is appreciated. Decreased ROM. Negative varus and valgus stress test.

RESULTS

X-rays of the right knee taken in office today reveal the bony alignment in good position. There is no evidence of any fractures. There is effusion present.

ASSESSMENT

Right knee pain, possible medial collateral ligament strain.

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I have had a lengthy discussion with the patient in regard to her current symptoms. I have prescribed the patient meloxicam 15 mg once a day to treat the pain and swelling. She was advised to stop taking any anti-inflammatory such as Motrin or Advil. I have also recommended that the patient attend formal physical therapy to strengthen her right knee. I have also advised her to continue to use the ACE wrap and wear a right knee brace for a few days. She should continue light walking with her brace on. The patient was advised to stop basketball until she follows up in 7 days.

Regarding her diabetes, she should continue to monitor her blood sugars daily. She should reach out to her primary care physician if she sees an increase in her blood sugars due to loss of activity.

INSTRUCTIONS

The patient will follow up with me in 7 days to check on her progress. If her swelling has not improved, we will consider obtaining a CT or MRI of the right knee to evaluate for a possible medial collateral ligament strain.

---------------------------------------------","[doctor] hi virginia how're you today
[patient] i'm good thanks how are you
[doctor] good so you know you got that knee x-ray when you first came in but tell me a little bit about what happened
[patient] i was playing basketball and jerry ran into me and the inside of my knee hurts
[doctor] okay did you fall to the ground or did you just kinda plant and he pushed and you went one way and your knee did n't
[patient] i did fall to the ground
[doctor] you did fall to the ground okay and did you land on the kneecap i mean did it hurt a lot were you able to get up and continue on
[patient] i landed on my side i was not able to continue on
[doctor] okay so you get off the off the court is jerry a good player you just got ta ask that question

[doctor] no
[patient] he does n't have much game
[doctor] okay okay well you know i love basketball i'm a little short for the game but i absolutely love to watch basketball so it's really cool that you're out there playing it so tell me about a little bit about where it hurts
[patient] on the inside
[doctor] on the inside of it okay and after the injury did they do anything special for you or you know did you get ice on it right away or try anything
[patient] i had ice and an ace wrap
[doctor] you had ice and what
[patient] an ace wrap
[doctor] and an ace wrap okay now how many days ago was this exactly
[patient] seven
[doctor] seven days ago okay yeah your right knee still looks a little swollen for seven days ago so i'm gon na go ahead and now i also see that you're diabetic and that you take five hundred milligrams of metformin twice a day are you still you're still on that medication is that correct
[patient] correct
[doctor] and do you check your blood sugars every morning at home
[patient] every morning
[doctor] okay great and since this i'm the reason i'm asking all these questions i'm a little concerned about the inactivity with your your knee pain and you know how diabetes you need to be very you know active and and taking your medicine to keep that under control so you know may wan na continue to follow up with your pcp for that diabetes as we go through here and just watch your blood sugars extra as we go through that now i'm gon na go ahead and examine your your right knee and when i push on the outside does that hurt at all
[patient] no
[doctor] okay and when i push on this inside where it's a little swollen does that hurt
[patient] yes
[doctor] yeah okay i'm just gon na ask a question did you hear or feel a pop in your knee when you were doing this
[patient] i did not no
[doctor] you did not okay okay what are you doing for the pain today
[patient] some exercises ice and mobic
[doctor] okay okay so i'm gon na continue all of my exam when i go ahead and pull on your knee the first thing i'm looking at is i do see some ecchymosis and swelling on the inside of that right knee and when i push around that knee i can see that there is fluid in the knee a little bit of fluid in the knee we call that effusion so i can appreciate some of that effusion and that could be either fluid or blood at this point from the injury that you had now you do have pain with palpation on the medial aspect of that right knee and that's that's concerning for me when i'm gon na just i just wan na move your knee a little bit it does n't look like when i extend it and flex it that you have a full range of motion does it hurt a lot when i moved it back a little more than normal
[patient] yes it hurts
[doctor] okay okay yeah so you do have some decreased range of motion in that right knee now i'm just gon na sit here and and lay you back and i'm gon na pull on your knee and twist your knee a little bit okay you currently there is a negative varus and valgus stress test that's really important so here's what i'm thinking for that right knee i think you have may have a medial collateral ligament strain from you know maybe the twisting motion be right before you fell to the ground i want you to continue to use an ace wrap i'm gon na give you a right knee brace we're gon na wear that for a few days and then i'm gon na send you to physical therapy so we can continue strengthening the muscles around the right knee now that x-ray as far as the x-ray results that x-ray that i did it this morning in the office the the bony alignment's in good position i do n't see any evidence of any fractures i do notice the the effusion around the right knee just a small amount of fluid but we're just gon na continue to watch that i'm gon na give you a prescription i'd like you to stop taking any of the nonsteroidals that you're taking the motrin or advil whichever one of those and i'm gon na give you meloxicam fifteen milligrams and i want you to take that daily for the pain and swelling i want you to just continue exercising with the the braces and everything on so if you can you can get out and do some light walking that'll be good and then again for your diabetes like i said just continue to watch those blood sugars daily and if you start to see any significant increase in them because of your loss of activity just reach out to your primary care physician now do you have any questions for me
[patient] when can i play basketball again
[doctor] yeah that's a great question i'm gon na ask well my first off i want to see you back here in in seven days you know in a week i want you to make an appointment we're gon na relook at it we're gon na determine if that swelling got any worse and if we need to go on to potentially ordering like a cat scan or an mri of that knee to look and see if there was any significant damage to the ligament so that's for for sure for seven days you're not gon na be playing basketball now are you in a ligue or is that just you get like pick up basketball
[patient] i just played the wife with fun
[doctor] okay okay good that's a great activity like i said i wish i could play now i i also know your your family do n't they own that sports store down right off a main street that sells a lot of sporting equipment

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

1. CHF.
- Medical Reasoning: The patient’s recent epsiode resulting in the emergency room visit was likely caused by his dietary indiscretion and uncontrolled hypertension that we have been monitoring.
- Patient Education and Counseling: I reviewed the echocardiogram results with the patient and discussed the importance of following dietary restrictions. I encouraged the patient to take his medication on a consistent basis. I advised him to purchase a scale to weigh himself daily.
- Medical Treatment: He will continue Bumex 2 mg once daily. He was provided with a referral to a nutritionist in consultation for further assistance with his dietary requirements to lower his sodium intake.

2. Hypertension.
- Medical Reasoning: This is currently uncontrolled.
- Patient Education and Counseling: I explained the importance of taking his medication on a daily basis. I encouraged the patient to purchase a blood pressure cuff and track his blood pressures.
- Medical Treatment: He will continue Cozaar 100 mg daily as well as the Norvasc 5 mg once daily. I will order a renal artery ultrasound for further evaluation.

3. Systolic ejection murmur.
- Medical Reasoning. Stable.

Patient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.

INSTRUCTIONS

Jeremy Roberts is a 79-year-old male who presents today for evaluation of a right foot ulcer. He reports an ulcer on his right foot has been present for approximately 6 to 8 weeks. He first noticed the ulcer after working outside. There is no associated pain, however, he feels the ulcer may have worsened from when he first noticed it. He denies experiencing any fevers or chills. He does however experience tension headaches quite frequently. He denies any pain in his calves when he walks. At this time the patient does not have a podiatrist for yearly foot exams.

He is a diabetic and takes insulin. His blood sugar has been running higher than normal and his last hemoglobin A1c was higher than 9. Occasionally he will also experience numbness and tingling in his feet, especially with colder weather.

In terms of his heart disease, the patient sustained a heart attack in 2018 and underwent stent placement at the right coronary artery. He is currently taking aspirin 81 mg daily. He denies chest pain or shortness of breath.

MEDICAL HISTORY

Patient reports history of diabetes and heart disease. He sustained a heart attack in 2018.

SURGICAL HISTORY

Patient reports undergoing stent placement at the right coronary artery.

SOCIAL HISTORY

Patient reports he is a former smoker. He previously smoked 2 packs a day for 20 years and was able to stop smoking approximately 4 years ago. Currently he is not very active but he does work around the house.

MEDICATIONS

Patient reports taking aspirin 81 mg daily and insulin.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Constitutional: Denies fevers and chills.
Cardiovascular: Denies chest pain.
Respiratory: Denies dyspnea.
Skin: Patient reports right foot ulcer.
Neurological: Patient reports headaches and numbness and tingling in feet.

VITALS

No fever.
Blood pressure: 127/80
Heart rate: 60s

PHYSICAL EXAM

CV: 2/6 systolic ejection murmur heard at the left base.
RESPIRATORY: Clear to auscultation bilaterally
NECK: No jugular venous distention or carotid bruits
MSK: Examination of the right lower extremity: No palpable dorsalis pedis or posterior tibial pulses. There is a 2 x 3 cm ulcerated lesion on the right lateral foot near the 5th metacarpal metatarsophalangeal joint. No associated cellulitis. No pain to palpation of the right foot. There is associated granulation tissue and some slight purulent discharge from the wound.

ASSESSMENT

1. Non-healing ulcer, right foot
2. Diabetes
3. Coronary artery disease

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination findings today, I have had a lengthy discussion with the patient in regards to his current symptoms. We discussed that his right foot ulcer is fairly sizable and will require wound care. I advised him that the ulcer does not appear to be healing and that further studies will be needed to assess if he has adequate blood supply to heal his foot wound. He was advised that due to his diabetes it is possible surgical intervention such as stent placement or bypass surgery may be required to improve his blood supply. I also advised him that I believe we will be able to heal his wound. At this time, I have recommended continued wound care and for him to also continue taking aspirin 81 mg daily. We will order an arterial ultrasound of the lower extremities. He will also be referred to podiatry for a consult.

Regarding his diabetes, this appears to be unstable as the patient reports his last hemoglobin a1c was greater than 9 and is now experiencing a non-healing right foot ulcer. We discussed the importance of blood sugar control as this will impact his wound healing. At this time, I have recommended that he follow-up with his primary care physician for further care.

The patient's coronary artery disease is currently stable. It is recommended that he continue to take his statin as prescribed. I will contact his cardiologist for medical clearance should surgical intervention be required for his non-healing right foot ulcer.

---------------------------------------------","[doctor] hi jeremy how are you
[patient] i'm really good thank you how are you
[doctor] i'm okay the the medical assistant told me that you had this ulcer on your foot that's been there for a couple of weeks
[patient] yes
[doctor] going away
[patient] yeah it's been there gosh it's like six or so weeks right now and it's and it's on my right foot and it's just yeah it's just not going away i'm not sure if it maybe even gotten a little worse from when i first noticed it
[doctor] okay and how long did you say it's going on for
[patient] probably about
[doctor] six eight weeks maybe
[patient] okay and do you have any pain in your foot no no no pain at all okay now i know that you're a diabetic and you are on some insulin have your sugars been running okay yeah they have been running
[doctor] okay
[patient] you know on the most part they seem to be running a little higher than normal
[doctor] your sugars are running higher than normal okay do you recall what your last hemoglobin a1c was was it above nine
[patient] yes it it it definitely was higher than nine
[doctor] okay alright now what do you think caused this ulcer were you wearing some tight fitting shoes or did you have some trauma to your foot or
[patient] yeah i was you know i think initially i'm you know i was out in the backyard you know kind of you know doing some work and you know i know i you know i could've stepped on a nail or you know there was some other work but you know i'm always outside so i do n't know if that kind of led to anything or caused anything
[doctor] okay alright and have you had any fever or chills
[patient] no no no fever or chills you know i kinda you know get headaches pretty often i do n't know if that you know i do n't know if that's a stress or but you know always have like the tension headaches in the front
[doctor] okay and do you have do you have neuropathy where you get like numbing and tingling in your feet
[patient] occasionally yeah occasionally especially when it's like colder outside
[doctor] mm-hmm kinda feels like it takes a little longer to
[patient] warm up but yeah i kinda have some sensation in in all my extremities
[doctor] okay alright and then are you are you a smoker or did you smoke
[patient] i did back you know kind of years ago i did but yeah i have n't smoked anything in in good number of years
[doctor] okay alright when did you stop smoking
[patient] couple years ago maybe four or so years ago
[doctor] okay alright and how many packs a day would you smoke
[patient] gosh back then yeah was at least two
[doctor] okay alright how many years did you smoke for like twenty
[patient] yeah at least twenty yeah twenty plus years
[doctor] okay alright now any other symptoms do you have any problems when you walk down the street do you get any pain in your calves at all when you walk
[patient] no no no no pain you know just kind of you know it's just i know that it's there
[doctor] okay and you said you're active you're out in the yard and things like that do you go on long walks at all or no
[patient] no no you know it's you know i just kinda feel like i've been just trying to take it easy lately
[doctor] mm-hmm
[patient] but yeah most most of the stuff i've been doing is just kind of hanging around the house
[doctor] okay alright so we talked a little bit about your diabetes let's talk about your heart disease now your heart disease you had a heart attack in twenty eighteen we put a stent into your right coronary artery you're still taking your medications for that you're still on your aspirin
[patient] i am yes yeah i do the baby aspirin every day
[doctor] okay alright and any chest pain or shortness of breath or anything like that no no yeah no nothing more than yeah i would n't attribute anything
[patient] okay and do you have a podiatrist for your yearly foot exams
[doctor] no i i i do n't okay alright alright well let's go ahead i wan na just do a quick physical exam i'm just gon na be calling out some of my exam findings so your vital signs here in the office you do n't have any fever so that's good your blood pressure is great it's like one twenty seven over eighty and your heart rate is nice and slow in the sixties on your neck exam i do n't appreciate any jugular venous distention or any carotid bruits on your lung exam your lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally on your heart exam you do have a two out of six systolic ejection murmur heard at the left base and on your lower extremity exam i do n't appreciate any palpable dorsalis pedis or posterior tibial pulses there is a two by three centimeter ulcerated lesion on the right lateral foot near the fifth metacarpal metatarsophalangeal joint there is no associated cellulitis does it hurt when i press here
[patient] no
[doctor] there is no pain to palpation of the right foot there is associated granulation tissue and some slight purulent discharge from the wound okay so what does all that mean that just means that you have this ulcer that's you know fairly sizable with i think we need to do some good wound care on it let's talk a little bit about my assessment and plan so you know i you have a nonhealing ulcer of your right foot so we need to do some studies on you to see if you have an adequate blood supply to heal this foot wound and since you since you probably do n't because of your diabetes you're here in a vascular surgeon's office we may have to go ahead and talk about being able to open up some of your arteries to improve the blood supply to your foot so that might mean getting a stent to one of your arteries in your legs to open up the blood supply it might mean mean that we might have to do some bypass surgery to to improve the blood supply to your foot in order to heal that that wound i do think that you'll be able to heal it i do n't think that we need to do anything drastic i want you to continue with your aspirin because that will help
[patient] any questions
[doctor] yeah i mean is this do we have to do any more tests or anything what are you we're gon na do an arterial ultrasound i'm going to go ahead and order an arterial ultrasound of your lower extremities to see what the blood supply is like and then i'm gon na go ahead and order a podiatry consult because i want them to see this wound and improve the wound care that you're doing and then for your next problem your diabetes i wan na go ahead and talk to your primary care physician we need to get your diabetes better controlled because that impacts your wound healing as well okay
[patient] sure
[doctor] sure understood alright and for your last issue your coronary artery disease continue with your statin and i will talk to your cardiologist in case you need a procedure to see if you're cleared from a medical standpoint okay
[patient] okay perfect
[doctor] alright
[patient] perfect thank you so much
[doctor] okay bye",2843.25,Patient reports taking aspirin 81 mg daily and insulin.,gemma_result,"Sure, here are all of  the medication that were mentioned in this transcript for a specific case where there was no info about any other meds besides aspirin and statin drugs already being taken:

---------------------------------------------","[doctor] hi virginia how are you today what brings you in
[patient] i'm doing alright i started seeing this new pcp last year and you know she has been doing a lot of changes to my medication and making sure everything is up to date and she my noticed that my blood pressure has been quite high so she added to medications but and but i you know i've been taking them i've been really good and i i before i was n't but now i am and we're still having a hard time controlling my blood pressure so she thought it would be a good idea for me to see you especially since she noted some on my last blood work she said something about my kidneys
[doctor] okay yeah so okay let's before i dive into a lot of that tell me a little bit about how you've been feeling
[patient] i would say you know most of the days i feel fine i'm still busy at work i definitely can tell though when my blood pressure is high
[doctor] okay you measure it at home you you you measure your blood pressure at home
[patient] yeah i she wanted me to get a blood pressure cuff so i did start getting checking my blood pressures probably like a few times a week
[doctor] okay
[patient] and so then i noticed that it has been getting higher the other day was even as high as one seventy over ninety
[doctor] wow
[patient] so i did call my pcp and she increased the meds again
[doctor] yeah okay now i i just have a couple questions about that are you using a an electronic blood pressure recorder or do you have somebody help you at home
[patient] yeah she i have a a electronic one an electronic arm one
[doctor] okay okay yeah that's good that's good and have you ever tried do you go to cvs at all
[patient] yeah i i do but i've noticed like since the pandemic i do n't see the blood pressures anymore
[doctor] okay okay yeah i i thought the one down on main street they i thought they just brought that one back so
[patient] did they
[doctor] yeah
[patient] that's good to know
[doctor] you may wan na check that but okay so that's good but i what i'd like you to do with that is i'd like you to keep a record of them for me for my next visit with you so let's talk a little bit about your diet tell me how how is your diet what what are the what kind of foods do you like what do you eat normally
[patient] alright do you want the honest answer
[doctor] well yeah that would be better
[patient] so i really you know with everything going on i really been trying to get better but i mean during football season it's really difficult i really love watching my games so have a lot of pizza wings subs like i said i've been trying to cut down especially on days where there is no games but it probably could be better
[doctor] okay i think we all can say that but i do wan na just hey i do n't know that if you've tried it or not but there is a new restaurant down on fifth street and it is nothing but solids and i you know when i heard this i was like okay yeah it's just another these solids are absolutely amazing so if you ever get a chance yeah if you ever get a chance try try that i mean i think you would enjoy them because they're salads that they make are just out unbelievable so let me go ahead and i just have a few more questions and i'm gon na just ask these in in order and you just tell me and then we will come back and talk about them do you have any headaches
[patient] really just when my blood pressure gets really high i have some mild headaches but otherwise i do n't have it on a regular basis
[doctor] okay what about chest pain
[patient] no chest pain
[doctor] shortness of breath
[patient] no shortness of breath
[doctor] even with exertion
[patient] even with exertion
[doctor] okay do you have any swelling in your lower extremities at all that you noticed
[patient] not if i'm on my feet for a long time i'll notice a little bit of swelling but otherwise no
[doctor] okay and then a couple other family history questions anybody in the family have kidney disease or significant high blood pressure
[patient] both my parents do have high blood pressure and one of them did have kidney disease
[doctor] okay okay and in the the the form that you filled out when you came in it says that you are on ten milligrams of norvasc daily and carvedilol twenty five milligrams twice a day is those the medicines you're on
[patient] yes i was also on lisinopril before but with the adjustments yeah those are the ones i'm on
[doctor] okay and so here's where i think we are going to go do you take any nonsteroidals like advil or motrin or aleve
[patient] yeah just once in a while for my like any knee pain or back pain that i have but again not like everyday
[doctor] okay and then lastly what kind of alcohol intake do you have you know do you consider how many drinks a week is really what i'm looking for
[patient] i'll have a couple of beers during the week and like one or two on the weekends
[doctor] okay okay so lem me do a quick physical examination so i looked at your vitals when you came in today and your blood pressure it's still high it's one sixty nine over seventy four your heart rate was eighty eight and your oxygenation was ninety eight percent so those are all fairly good except that blood pressure's a little higher than we'd like to see now when i look at your neck i do n't see any jugular vein distention and i'm gon na listen here real quick no i do n't hear any carotid bruits i'm gon na listen to your lungs okay your lungs are clear and let me listen quickly to your heart i do hear that a two over six systolic ejection murmur and we'll we're gon na have to take a little bit look extra look at that that's when i i can hear an extra sound when i'm listening to your heart and you do have a small amount of one plus pitting edema bilaterally now i did so you do have that your diagnosis is uncontrolled hypertension you know and i think you're aware that that's what your your physician's been treating you for and most of the time this cause is is the cause of this is multifactorial it's not that there is just one thing causing it so we may need to be changing your medicine around and i'm gon na talk to your doctor but first thing before we make any more medication changes i want to order some tests first to rule out if there is any specific cause for this so first order will be a renal artery ultrasound and what i'm looking for there is that there is no areas of areas of narrowing in the the blood vessels of your kidneys that would be the cause of your hypertension in addition to that i'm gon na order a you get another urine collection some morning aldosterone levels reining levels and a twenty four hour urine and these things can really show me if there is any problems with your adrenal glands again this is a lot of big words but you know i'm i i'll write this all out for you i want you to decrease your alcohol i know you like those beers but let's bring it down to maybe one a week or two a week just to get those down lower and then your salt intake you need to be very judicious about decreasing that salt intake i'm gon na give you a referral to a nutritionist to discuss those changes for that you need and and they will help you get that cleared up and then finally stop taking any nonsteroidal medicines such as your advil or motrin the only thing i really want to want you taking is tylenol for any pain right now i am gon na prescribe one medicine and that's cardura four milligrams and i want you to take that once a day and that's good to see if that can help us with your blood pressure and then finally three weeks i'd like you to return i want you to record all of your blood pressures that you take over the next three weeks and bring them into the office but most importantly if you can try to take them at the same time everyday that would be beneficial for me any questions for me
[patient] no i i just it's a lot so i i'm hoping this will work and this will get it under control
[doctor] yeah i i think you know this will be you know this we're gon na spend some time together so i'm glad to have you as a patient but you know we got ta try to get this under control and i'm gon na i'll be talking to your pcp just to let them know that you know what my plans are and we'll stay real in sync on treating this as we move forward does that sound like a plan

Chief Complaint: left arm pain 
Secondary Complaints: hand pain 

---------------------------------------------
MEDICAL NOTE:

CHIEF COMPLAINT

Left arm pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

He reports that his left arm pain began approximately 2 weeks ago. He woke around 2:00 am with intense pain in his left arm and hand. He applied ice and after 2-3 hours, the pain improved and he was able to go back to sleep, the pain did not return until that evening. After several nights of experiencing the left arm and hand pain, he was seen by Betty Ross, PA-C. She suspected a pinched nerve and completed x-rays of the cervical spine, prescribed gabapentin and prednisone, and referred the patient to us. The patient has benefited from the gabapentin and prednisone, reporting improvement of pain at night.

The pain initially was encountered at night, but the patient notes that the symptoms carry into the next day. He denies pain when moving his neck, turning his head, and moving his shoulder.

Mr. Clark does report a history of a left finger injury, stating “it rarely works”, and neuropathy in one leg from his knee to his foot which he receives 1% disability for. The patient is a veteran.

PAST HISTORY

Medical
Peripheral neuropathy.

SOCIAL HISTORY

The patient is a veteran and receives 1% disability.

CURRENT MEDICATIONS

Gabapentin tablet.
Prednisone tablet.

PHYSICAL EXAM

Constitutional
Elderly Caucasian male in no apparent distress. Presents in wheelchair.

Neurologic
Upper extremities: 1+ bilateral biceps, triceps, brachioradialis, reflexes bilaterally, negative. Negative Hoffman's
Gait: Not assessed today.

Strength
Upper extremities: Normal throughout the biceps, triceps, deltoid, grip strength, and finger abduction, bilaterally.
Sensation: Intact to light touch throughout the upper and lower extremities.

Musculoskeletal
Cervical: Nontender over cervical spine. Mildly restricted cervical extension and right and left lateral rotation, which is symmetric, which gives him mild lateral neck pain, but no radicular pain. Spurling's maneuver is benign.

RESULTS

X-ray Cervical Spine, 06/04/2021.
Impression: Significant disc degeneration at C5-6 and to a lesser extent C4-5 and C3-4. Significant lower facet arthropathy. C6-7 and C7-T1 are difficult to visualize in the current x-rays.

ASSESSMENT

• Left upper extremity neuropathy, suspicious for cervical radiculopathy, possible contribution of peripheral neuropathy
• Neck pain in the setting of arthritis and disc generation

PLAN

I suspect that this is a flare of cervical radiculopathy. I am going to set him up for a cervical MRI. We will tentatively plan for a left C7-T1 epidural afterwards, although the exact level will be pending the MRI results. He will continue his home exercise program as well as twice daily gabapentin. We will follow up with him afterwards to determine his level of relief. He denies any blood thinners.

This plan was discussed in detail with the patient who is in agreement.

INSTRUCTIONS

Continue home exercise program and twice daily gabapentin. Schedule MRI and epidural injection. Follow-up after epidural.

---------------------------------------------","[doctor] dictating on donald clark . date of birth , 03/04/1937 . chief complaint is left arm pain . hello , how are you ?
[patient] good morning .
[doctor] it's nice to meet you . i'm dr. miller .
[patient] it's nice to meet you as well .
[doctor] so , i hear you are having pain this arm . is that correct ?
[patient] that's correct .
[doctor] okay . and it seems like it's worse at night ?
[patient] well , right now the hand is .
[doctor] mm-hmm .
[patient] and the thing started about two weeks ago . i woke up about two o'clock in the morning and it was just hurting something awful .
[doctor] uh- .
[patient] and then i laid some ice on it and it finally did ease up .
[doctor] okay , that's good .
[patient] so i got up , i sat on the side of the bed and held my arm down , thinking it would , like , help the circulation , but it did n't .
[doctor] okay , i see .
[patient] and so , after a while , when it eased off , maybe about four , five am , i laid back down and it did n't start up again .
[doctor] mm-hmm , okay .
[patient] um . i went back to sleep but for several nights this happened , like , over and over . so , i finally went to see the doctor , and i do n't really recall her name .
[doctor] okay . yeah , i think i know who you're talking about , though .
[patient] um , she's the one who sent me to you , so , i , i would , i would think so . but when i went to her after the third time it happened and she checked me out , she said it was most likely coming from a pinched nerve .
[doctor] probably . uh , do you notice that moving your neck or turning your head seems to bother your arm ?
[patient] uh , no .
[doctor] okay . is moving your shoulder uncomfortable at all ?
[patient] no .
[doctor] and do you notice it at other times besides during the night ?
[patient] um , some days . if it bothers me at night , then the day following , it usually will bother me some .
[doctor] okay . and do you just notice it in the hand , or does it seem to be going down the whole arm ?
[patient] well , it starts there and goes all the way down the arm .
[doctor] okay . have you noticed any weakness in your hand at all ?
[patient] uh , yes .
[doctor] okay . like , in terms of gripping things ?
[patient] yeah .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] uh , this finger , i hurt it some time ago as well .
[doctor] really ?
[patient] yeah . it does n't work properly . or , it works very rarely .
[doctor] gotcha . and did i hear that she gave you some prednisone and some oral steroids , or ?
[patient] uh , well , she gave me some numbing medicine . it helped a little bit . the other two were a neck pill and gabapentin . uh , you should have my full list in your notes , though . since then it has n't really bothered me at night . also , just so you know , i am a va and i'm one percent disabled from this leg , um , issues from my knees down to my feet .
[doctor] okay . is it neuropathy ?
[patient] uh , yep .
[doctor] gotcha . that is good to know . all right , well , let's go ahead and take a look .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] all right . so , to start , i'm gon na have you do something for me . uh , just go ahead and tilt your chin as far as you can down to your chest . okay , good . and now , go the other way , tilting your chin up as far as you can . now , does that seem to bother you at all ? okay . and now , come back to normal , just look and turn your head as far as you can that way . great . and now , as far as you can towards that wall . uh , does that seem to bother you at all ?
[patient] no . well , actually , i do feel a little strain .
[doctor] okay . so , you feel it in the neck a little bit ?
[patient] yeah , just a little strain .
[doctor] okay . uh , now squeeze my fingers as hard as you can with both hands . great . now , hold your arms like this .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] and i'm going to try to strain your arms and try to keep them as stiff as you can . do n't let me strain it . okay , good . good . now , when i , i'm just touching your hands like this . does it seem to feel about the same in both hands ?
[patient] uh , yes .
[doctor] okay . all right . so , i do agree with betty . uh , more than likely , this seems like it would be coming from your neck . that's the most common reason that causes what , what you're experiencing . and i looked at an x-ray of your neck , and you do seem to have a lot of arthritis there , and there does seem to be potential for a disc to be pushing on a nerve . and now , what i do n't have is an mri , which would show me , uh , kind of exactly where the nerve roots are getting pinched off .
[patient] i see .
[doctor] so , gabapentin can help a little bit with the nerve pain , and what i would like to do is potentially set you up for an epidural . and what that is is it , it's a focused anti-inflammatory medicine , excuse me , that works behind the nerve roops that , nerve roots that we are thinking might be getting squished off . it can often help alleviate your symptoms , and i do need to get an mri of your neck . um , i know we have had one of your lower back , but i need one of your neck to see exactly where the roots are getting pinched off . so , what i can do is tentatively set you up for an epidural , but before you do that , we do need to get that mri so i can see right where i need to put the medicine for your epidural . uh , what do you think of that ?
[patient] i think that sounds good to me .
[doctor] okay , good . and just to confirm , do you take any blood thinners ? i do n't think i saw any on your medicine list .
[patient] uh , no , i do n't .
[doctor] okay , good . and what i would have you do is continue with the gabapentin . um , are you taking 300 or 100 ?
[patient] um , not sure . my lady friend helps me handle this stuff .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] i am taking eliquis , though .
[doctor] okay . um , so whatever you are doing you can just keep doing it , and i'm going to set you up for the epidural and imaging study , um , just so i know right where to put the medicine . and i will follow up with you after s- um , that's in . we can do the shot , just to make sure your arm is feeling better . sound good ?
[patient] sounds good . for the last couple of nights , though , my neck has not been bothering me .
[doctor] okay . s- um , so , presumably what's happening , then , is when you're sleeping your neck is kind of gets off-tilt , uh , kilter , and it compresses the nerve roots there . now , if you think you're doing fine , we could hold off , but at the very la- least , i'd like to update that mri of yours and see what's going on , because probably this is something that will likely flare up again .
[patient] yeah , it , it has been for the last week , so , i understand .
[doctor] okay . all right . well , do you want to do that work-up and do the epidural , or do you think you're doing fine and you want to wait ?

MEDICAL NOTE:

CHIEF COMPLAINT

Smoking cessation.

MEDICAL HISTORY

Patient reports a history of type 2 diabetes, gout, and a 2/6 Systolic ejection murmur.

SOCIAL HISTORY

Patient reports he is a smoker.

MEDICATIONS

Patient reports taking allopurinol.

VITALS

Oxygen Saturation: 98% on room air.
Blood Pressure: 128/88 mmHg.
Heart Rate: 68 beats per minute.
Respiratory Rate: 16 breaths per minute.

PHYSICAL EXAM

Neck
- General Examination: Neck is supple without lymphadenopathy. No carotid bruits.

Respiratory
- Auscultation of Lungs: Clear bilaterally. No expiratory wheezes, rales, or rhonchi.

Cardiovascular
- Auscultation of Heart: Regular rate. 2/6 systolic ejection murmur.

Hematology/Lymphatic/Immunology
- Palpation: No enlarged lymph nodes.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

1. Nicotine dependence.
- Medical Reasoning: The patient has a long history of smoking cigarettes. He is currently smoking 1.5 packs per day. He is highly motivated to cease smoking as he is preparing to become a father.
- Patient Education and Counseling: I applaud the patient on making this first step to stop smoking. I reassured him that with absolute 100% certainty that I will be with him every step of the way. I explained to the patient that stress can often be a trigger for smoking. He received handouts today for common smoking triggers. I advised him to be watchful and monitor his stress level, not only regarding work, but also his impending fatherhood. The patient and I discussed coping mechanisms for when he encounters stressful situations. I encouraged him to maintain his gym routine, engage in meditation, and try adding in yoga to help further reduce his stress levels. We discussed additional cessation aids.
- Medical Treatment: The patient has chosen his birthday, as a quit date. On that day, I am going to start him with a 21 mg nicotine patch, and the goal will be to decrease that over time. We will work together to decrease the dosage of the nicotine patch, so there are not necessarily any hard dates in mind. I recommend he change the patch location each day as that will help reduce or avoid any skin irritation that can occur if he re-uses the same location repeatedly.

2. Type 2 diabetes.
- Medical Reasoning: Stable.
- Patient Education and Counseling: We discussed that continuing to follow a healthy diet and perform regular exercise will help to maintain his blood glucose levels.
- Medical Treatment: We will continue to monitor his type 2 diabetes. Hemoglobin A1c is ordered to be completed by his next visit in 2 weeks.

3. History of gout.
- Medical Reasoning: Stable with medication.
- Patient Education and Counseling: I advised him to continue to watch for foods that will exacerbate his uric acid levels.
- Medical Treatment: He will continue his allopurinol.

Patient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.

INSTRUCTIONS

I would like to see him again in 2 weeks to discuss how things are going and to reevaluate the nicotine patch dosage.

MEDICAL NOTE:

CHIEF COMPLAINT

Right hip pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Elizabeth Reyes is a 56-year-old female who presents for the evaluation of pain in her right hip and groin region. Her symptoms started on 02/2020 and has progressively worsened. She is employed as an RN and notes that her symptoms began while she was working and walking around the infusion room at Johnson. Initially the pain would only happen when she took a step back, but the pain has progressed and now occurs with any type of movement involving her right hip and groin. She describes that her hip will sometimes “catch” when she moves, causing her to fall on occasion. The pain improves when she is still and stops moving. She rates her pain as 2-7/10.

Starting in 2018, the patient intentionally lost 110 pounds through Weight Watchers. She has maintained the weight loss and her weight has been stabile for the past 1 year. She has a history of several bulging discs, but the pain has significantly reduced due to her weight loss. Today, she reports no back pain.

She denies fever, chills, new onset of bowel or bladder dysfunction, tingling or numbness.

Motor bulk and tone are normal in both lower extremities. Motor strength testing reveals no focal motor weakness in the lower extremities. Deep tendon reflexes are 1+ throughout. No focal sensory deficit is noted.

RESULTS

MR arthrogram of the right hip completed on 06/03/2021 reveals evidence of high-grade chondromalacia involving the anterosuperior right acetabulum with subchondral marrow edema and cyst formation.

ASSESSMENT

• Right hip degenerative joint disease.

PLAN

I discussed the clinical and radiological findings with the patient. Treatment options discussed are low impact exercises, use of analgesics as needed, and use of a cane to offload the right hip. She would like to proceed with a cortisone injection into her right hip joint. We will administer the injection today. I reviewed the procedure in detail, including the risks of the injection related to the use of steroid in the COVID setting. She understands the risks and would like to proceed with the injection.

INSTRUCTIONS

Schedule a follow up appointment in 3 months to assess her pain. If needed, a second injection may be administered.","[doctor] good morning ms. reyes !

- Medical Reasoning: The patient's physical exam is consistent with this diagnosis.
- Patient Education and Counseling: We discussed that his pumping function should improve in time. We also discussed that since he is compliant with his medications and presented to the cardiac cath lab quickly, he should recover. I advised the patient that he does not need to start a diuretic at this time.
- Medical Treatment: Continue taking lisinopril 20 mg a day. Prescription for Aldactone 12.5 mg daily provided. Order for labs provided. Repeat echocardiogram ordered to be completed in 2 months.

[patient] that sounds great thank you
[doctor] okay and then lastly for the painful swallowing that you're having so the inflammation you're having it not only in your lungs but it also in your esophagus as well so what i'm gon na do is prescribe you you're taking the the prednisone i'm also gon na give you a lidocaine swish and swallow and you can do that four times a day and so that will be able to help you so you can eat immediately after taking it and it can also help so that you can continue to take food and fluids prevent dehydration and any further weight loss

MEDICAL NOTE:

CHIEF COMPLAINT

History of right ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS).

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Sophia Brown is a 75 y.o. female who presents today for a new patient evaluation due to her history of right DCIS. She is doing well but wishes to establish care today for continued monitoring.

The patient underwent a screening mammogram in 10/2019 and was found to have a calcification in the right breast. She then had a right breast ultrasound on 11/03/2019 which revealed a mass at the 2 o’clock position, 11 cm from the nipple, in the retroareolar region. The report states the mass was 0.4 by 2.0 by 3.0 centimeters. She subsequently had an ultrasound-guided core needle biopsy on 12/05/2019 and pathology results revealed grade 2 ER-positive, PR-positive DCIS. The patient then had a lumpectomy with lymphadenectomy performed on 01/20/2020. The tumor was 8 mm with negative margins and the 5 lymph nodes removed were all benign. Pathology from the tumor confirmed DCIS. Her lumpectomy was followed by adjuvant radiation therapy. Endocrine therapy was also offered but the patient declined. She has since had a mammogram in 01/2021 which was normal. The patient also reports that she performs self-breast exams regularly at home.

Mrs. Brown is a G5P5 female and estimates that her last menstrual period was approximately 30 years ago. She is not currently and has never been on hormone replacement therapy.

The patient’s last colonoscopy was done in 2018. She had a sigmoid polypectomy at that time and pathology showed a tubular adenoma.

Her cholesterol was recently noted to be elevated and the patient reports that she is exercising and reducing fatty food intake accordingly. This is being followed by her primary care provider.

PAST HISTORY

Medical

Positive for back pain, joint pain, high cholesterol. Patient has sought care for these complaints. She reports that she was told the back pain and joint pain (knee) are age-related. She is being followed for the high cholesterol by her primary care provider.

PHYSICAL EXAM

The ECOG performance status today is grade 0.
Breast: There are no palpable masses; however, there is some skin thickening at the medial inferior aspect of the right breast which may be radiation skin changes.

ASSESSMENT

Stage 0 ER/PR-positive invasive ductal carcinoma of the right breast.
The patient is status post lumpectomy with removal of 5 lymph nodes which were benign. She also underwent adjuvant radiation therapy but declined endocrine therapy. Today’s clinical examination shows no evidence of recurrent disease or other malignancy. She also had a negative mammogram in 01/2021.

PLAN

1. We will continue to observe the patient.
2. She is due for a mammogram in 04/2022.

[patient] you as well .
[doctor] so , you've come to see me today because you had a right breast lumpectomy last year . is that right ?
[patient] yes . on january 20th , 2020 .
[doctor] okay . and how have you been since then ? any problems or concerns ?
[patient] no , i'm feeling good . i do my self breast exams religiously now and have n't felt anything since .
[doctor] perfect . i want to back up and go over your history so i can make sure everything in your chart is correct and i do n't miss anything . so , i'll tell you what we have in your chart from your other providers and you tell me if anything is wrong or missing . sound good ?
[patient] sounds good .
[doctor] great . so , i have that you were found to have a calcification in your right breast during a mammogram in october 2019 . was that just a normal screening mammogram , or was it done because you felt a lump ?
[patient] it was just a normal one you're supposed to get every so often .
[doctor] i see . and then it looks like you had an ultrasound of your right breast on november 3rd , 2019 , which revealed a mass at the two o'clock position , 11 centimeters from the nipple in the retroareolar region . the report states the mass was point four by two by three centimeters .
[patient] yes , that sounds right . hard to remember now , though .
[doctor] yep , definitely .
[doctor] based on those results , they decided to do an ultrasound-guided core needle biopsy on december 5th , 2019 . pathology results during that biopsy came back as grade two , er positive , pr positive , dcis , or ductal carcinoma in situ .
[patient] yes . unfortunately .
[doctor] i know . scary stuff . but you had a lumpectomy on january 20th , 2020 , which removed the eight millimeter tumor and margins were negative . the pathology confirmed dcis . looks like they also removed 5 lymph nodes , which , thankfully , were negative for malignancy . that's great !
[patient] yeah , i was definitely very relieved .
[doctor] and your last mammogram was in january 2021 ? and that was normal .
[patient] yes .
[doctor] okay . so , i feel like i have a good grasp of what's been going on with you now . and you're here today to establish care with me so i can continue to follow you and make sure you're doing well , right ?
[patient] yes . fingers crossed .
[doctor] definitely . we'll keep a close eye on you and take good care of you .
[patient] okay , sounds good .
[doctor] i have a few more questions for you . when was your last colonoscopy ?
[patient] i had one in 2018 and , if i remember correctly , i had one polyp and that was removed and it was n't cancerous .
[doctor] okay , yes , i see that report now . one polyp in the sigmoid colon which had a benign tubular adenoma . okay . and when was your last menstrual period ?
[patient] gosh . it was probably around 30 years ago .
[doctor] okay . do you have children ?
[patient] i do . i have five .
[doctor] ah , big family then . that's nice .
[patient] yes . and they're all having kids of their own now , so it's getting even bigger .
[doctor] i bet . sounds like fun .
[patient] it is .
[doctor] did you have any other pregnancies that were miscarriages or terminations ?
[patient] really , i did not .
[doctor] okay . so for the record , that's g5 p5 . and now that you're post-menopausal , are you currently or have you ever been on hormone replacement therapy ?
[patient] my primary care doctor gave me the option years ago but i decided against it .
[doctor] okay . and on your review systems form , you indicated that you've not had any recent weight loss or gain , headaches , bone pain , urinary symptoms , or blood in the stools . but you did indicate that you have some back pain , joint pain , and high cholesterol . tell me some more about those .
[patient] okay . so i've seen doctors for all of those . they've said , excuse me , the back and knee pain are age-related . and the cholesterol is a fairly new diagnosis , but i am working on exercise and cutting back on fatty foods to see if i can get it lower without any medication .
[doctor] okay . and your primary care doctor is following you for that , right ?
[patient] that's correct .
[doctor] okay . for medications , i have that you take coq10 , vitamin d , vitamin c , fish oil , and elderberry fruit . is that all right ?
[patient] yes , and that's all .
[doctor] okay . so for your medical history , it's high cholesterol and stage 0 er/pr positive invasive ductal carcinoma of the right breast . any surgeries other than the lumpectomy ?
[patient] i did have my tubes tied after my last baby , but that's all .
[doctor] okay . and how about family history ?
[patient] my mom had non-hodgkin's lymphoma and my dad had prostate cancer and heart disease , but i think that's it .
[doctor] all right . any family history of breast cancer ?
[patient] none .
[doctor] did any of your children have medical issues or siblings with medical problems ?
[patient] i do not have any siblings and , thankfully , my children are all healthy .
[doctor] wonderful . do you have any history of smoking , illicit drug use , heavy alcohol consumption ?
[patient] no drugs . i do drink socially , but never more than that . and i used to smoke , but really , everybody did back then and i probably quit about 30 years ago .
[doctor] excellent . i have that you're allergic to penicillin . any other allergies ?
[patient] nope , just penicillin .
[doctor] okay . i think that covers it . hop up here and let me take a look at you .
[doctor] okay , so let's use the normal new patient exam template . only change to make is the breast exam . there are no palpable masses , however , there is skin thickening at the medial inferior aspect of the right breast which may be radiation skin changes .
[doctor] in the result section , note that her ecog performance status today is zero .
[doctor] do you have ... did you have radiation after the lumpectomy ?
[patient] i did . we also talked about endocrine therapy , but i decided against that .
[doctor] okay . so your exam looks good , no masses , just some skin changes from that radiation . now , let's go over the plan for you .
[patient] okay , sounds good .
[doctor] as you know , you've had dcis which we'll list in my note as stage zero , er/pr positive , invasive ductal carcinoma of the right breast . your status post-lumpectomy with removal of five lymph nodes that were benign . you also had , um , radiation therapy but declined endocrine therapy . today's clinical examination shows no evidence of recurrence with the dcis or other malignancy and your mammogram in january , 2021 was also negative for recurrence and malignancy .
[doctor] so , based on all of that , we can just continue to observe you .
[patient] okay . that sounds great . and when do i come back in to see you ?
[doctor] in a year , but you should have another mammogram in april of 2022 before you come back to see me .
[patient] okay , i can do that .
[doctor] wonderful . i'm glad to see you doing so well . do you have any questions or concerns i can address for you today ?

Chief Complaint: right elbow pain
Secondary Complaints: nan

MEDICAL NOTE:

CHIEF COMPLAINT

Right elbow pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Lawrence Butler is a pleasant 45-year-old male who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of right elbow pain.

Over the past week, the patient has developed 6/10 pain in the ""inside"" of his right elbow. The pain may radiate into his forearm on occasion, but does not extend up to his shoulder. He denies any history of trauma or injury, but he did start making pottery during the COVID-19 pandemic and suspects that his symptoms could be related to that. His symptoms affect his ability to lift objects or perform his typical activities of daily living. Ibuprofen provides minimal symptomatic relief.

SOCIAL HISTORY

The patient reports that he began making pottery during the COVID-19 pandemic.

MEDICATIONS

The patient reports that he has been taking ibuprofen.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Musculoskeletal: Reports right elbow pain.

VITALS

Normal

PHYSICAL EXAM

MSK: Examination of the right elbow: Moderate tenderness at the medial epicondyle. No pain with supination of the forearm. Pain with pronation of the forearm. Pain with resistance against flexion of the wrist.

RESULTS

X-ray imaging of the right elbow was obtained and reviewed in office today. These reveal no evidence of fracture or bony abnormality.

ASSESSMENT

Right medial epicondylitis.

PLAN

The patient and I discussed his diagnosis in detail, and I explained that his symptoms are likely caused by overuse and potential damage of the tendons. We will provide him with sling to be worn during the day while he is awake. I want him to take ibuprofen 600 mg every 6 hours with food for a full week and ice the elbow for 20 minutes, 3 times daily. Finally, I advised the patient to rest his elbow and avoid doing any pottery for the next couple of weeks.

INSTRUCTIONS

The patient will follow up in 1 week.

[patient] and i've been in a lot of pain it started about i would say probably about three days ago
[doctor] okay
[patient] started having pain on my left back
[doctor] okay
[patient] and since then i continued to have pain it is traveling a little lower it's gotten little low but i definitely have not passed it yet and i'm just in so much pain
[doctor] okay so is the pain that you're having is it constant or does it come and go
[patient] it's constant
[doctor] okay
[patient] all the time i ca n't get comfortable
[doctor] alright are you able to urinate
[patient] i am and this morning i actually started seeing some blood
[doctor] okay yeah so and i know you said i see you've had some kidney stones in the past like how many times would you say you've had one of these episodes
[patient] i've had it for probably this might be my third time
[doctor] third time alright
[patient] yeah i have n't had one in a while but yeah this is my third time
[doctor] okay so have you noticed any nausea chills fever
[patient] no fever some chills and i i just in so much pain i i ca n't eat and i do feel a little nauseous
[doctor] okay that sound definitely understandable so you've been in a lot of pain so have you tried to take any medications to alleviate the pain
[patient] yeah i've been taking tylenol i have had to try some ibuprofen i know you said to be careful with my blood pressure but i have been trying to do that because i'm just in so much pain and it's not really working
[doctor] okay and before what would you how long would you say it took you to pass the other stones or how was that that resolved
[patient] yeah usually usually about about three four days to pass it yeah
[doctor] right so this is this is the looks like this is the third day
[patient] yeah
[doctor] so we are getting close there
[patient] okay
[doctor] yeah so hopefully we can pass it but we'll i'll definitely we can take a look at it here in a second so while you are here i also wanted to check up on your your diabetes and and hypertension you have so i'm looking here at my notes and you're on two . five of norvasc for your high blood pressure when you came in today your blood pressure was a was a little bit high and i know that's probably because you are in a bunch of pain so that definitely makes sense but i think last time we talked a little bit about you getting a blood pressure cuff and taking your blood pressures regularly so those readings first off were you able to get the blood pressure cuff
[patient] i was i have n't been great about taking it but i did get the blood pressure cuff
[doctor] so the time that you did take it and i think that's something we got to work on is you've taken them i think at least three times a week i would like you to what have those been running
[patient] like the top numbers they're usually the one thirties sometimes i get i do go into one forties and once it went to like one fifty
[doctor] okay
[patient] and then the bottom number has been between seventy and eighty okay that i mean that's not too bad i think when you were first diagnosed you were up there in the
[doctor] the one eighties which was really high
[patient] right
[doctor] so let me talk a little bit also about you trying to lower your salt intake to like like twenty three hundred milligrams a a day so have you been able to do that
[patient] trying my best but doc i really like my french fries
[doctor] yeah
[patient] like
[doctor] we we all like we all like the french fries you know but you know we we we we also do n't like strokes so we do n't want to have a scope and all the all the french fries so that's something definitely i would like you to work on and do you think you'd be able to to curb that french fry habit or that bad this bad food habits by yourself or do you think you need help
[patient] yeah some help could be helpful okay yeah we can definitely get you connected with someone just to help you with your diet kinda that's the biggest thing for a lot of my patient is trying to control that diet alright
[doctor] so i also want to take a look here at your diabetes and last time you came in your a1c was a little bit higher at seven . three and you're on five hundred of metformin currently so have you been taking your blood sugars before you eat everyday
[patient] i have and those those have been pretty good they are like in the low one hundreds
[doctor] okay that that that's definitely good because when you came in i think we did a glucose test on you couple of months ago and you were around three hundred which is which is pretty up there so i'm glad that you know those levels are down and have you been taking that metformin everyday
[patient] i do
[doctor] okay
[patient] i do take it
[doctor] that that that that's really good alright so let me do a quick physical exam on you just a couple of questions before i take a look at your your abdomen and and your back talked to take a look at that that kidney stones you're having so i just want to make sure are you having any any chest pain
[patient] no chest pain
[doctor] no chest pain are you having any belly pain
[patient] the back pain is starting to kind of go down into my groin but i would n't say any back pain i mean abdominal pain
[doctor] no abdominal pain alright so let me check here i'm gon na listen to your heart real quick and so on your heart exam i do hear a grade two out of six systolic ejection murmur and that we knew about that already so not really worried about that currently listen to your lungs your lungs are clear bilaterally i do n't hear any crackles or wheezes so let me press here on your abdomen does that hurt
[patient] yes
[doctor] okay i'm gon na press here on your back is that painful
[patient] yes
[doctor] alright so on your examination of your abdomen there is tenderness to palpation of the abdomen there is n't any rebound or guarding though and only there is also cva tinnitus on the right on your on your flank as well and so it seems to me you know that you do have that kidney stone looks like you do have some inflammation around your kidney that's what that that's that tenderness around your cva is is telling me so let's go talk a little bit about my assessment and plan for you so you know right now because of your history of of having kidney stones you you do have a kidney stone so what we're gon na do is first off i'm gon na get you some pain medication kinda you're in a ton of pain right now i'm gon na prescribe you some oxycodone five milligrams you can take that every six to eight hours as needed for pain and so hopefully that can help you feeling better and you can continue to take that tylenol for any breakthrough pain that you're having i do wan na make sure that you're pushing fluids right now because we need to try to push that stone out that you're having just kinda clear your kidneys and that that would definitely help i also want to give you a strainer so you can strain your urine to see if you do actually pass that stone and then i'm going to refer you to urology and we're actually i'm gon na have you you even if you pass a stone in the next couple of days i want you to go anyway because it seems like you're having recurrent kidney stones and so hopefully they can help do something to to help this from happening in the future for your hypertension i'm gon na keep you on that two . five norvasc your your blood pressures look good so i'm not gon na make any changes there and then for your diabetes we'll keep you on the five hundred of metformin and i also want to give you a referral to nutrition to a dietitian and they will be able to help you with your your diet i know you said you have a few issues so you know they can possibly write a diet for you and if you follow it you know hopefully in the future we can get you off of both of these medications and get you back to normal so how does that all sound
[patient] that sounds good and i i just i just want this pain to go away so thank you

MEDICAL NOTE:

CHIEF COMPLAINT

Iron deficiency anemia.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Mrs. Christina Cooper is a 65-year-old female who presents with a long-history of iron deficiency anemia.

The patient reports she has been living with anemia since she was 13 years old. She attempted to donate blood on 12/2019 but was unable to due to her anemia. She has a history of heavy menstruation and a hysterectomy in 1996. She completed a colonoscopy 5-6 years ago with nonsignificant findings. She denies having a pacemaker, defibrillator, sleep apnea, or using oxygen.

Mrs. Cooper reports a myriad of symptoms, stating she feels fatigued often during the day, feverish with chills at times, and during activity feels she cannot catch her breath and some wheezing is present. She has been having some headaches which is uncommon for her. Additionally, she is noticing tingling sensations, cold sensitivity, and her anxiety and depression have worsened.

PAST HISTORY

Surgical
Hysterectomy, 1996.

Procedures
Colonoscopy 5-6 years ago.

SOCIAL HISTORY

Drink’s alcohol 1-2 times per year.

CURRENT MEDICATIONS

Ferrous Sulfate 25 mg tablet twice per day (1 in the morning, 1 in the evening), Vitamin B12 OTC.

PHYSICAL EXAM

Gastrointestinal
Abdomen non-tender.

ASSESSMENT

• Iron deficiency anemia

Mrs. Cooper is a 65-year-old female who was diagnosed with iron deficiency anemia in 12/2019 and was unable to donate blood. Her follow-up blood work in 01/2020 revealed a low hemoglobin, stable hematocrit, and normal iron labs, although, ferritin was low. She has been taking ferrous sulfate 325 mg by mouth.

PLAN

I have asked her to continue each ferrous sulfate dose with vitamin C found in orange juice for the next 12 weeks then recheck CBC, iron ferritin, B-12, and folate. A referral was sent for her to see a hematologist. We will plan for EGD and colonoscopy to assess for potential sources of anemia or GI bleed. If this is inconclusive, capsule endoscopy can be considered.

INSTRUCTIONS

Schedule upper endoscopy, colonoscopy and appointment with hematologist. Return to the clinic if symptoms worsen.

---------------------------------------------","[doctor] today i'm seeing christina cooper . her date of birth is 07/01/1954 . uh , ms. cooper is a new patient who was referred by diane nelson for a long-standing iron deficiency anemia .
[doctor] hello , how are you ?
[patient] i'm good , thank you .
[doctor] so tell me what brings you in today .
[patient] recently i tried to donate blood , around december i think , and they told me i was anemic , which is something i've been dealing with for a while , so it's not the first time i've been told i'm anemic .
[doctor] or how have you been feeling in general with this ?
[patient] not great . i have been feeling fatigued often during the day , and even feverish with chills at times . when i try to be active i like i ca n't catch my breath and i feel like i'm wheezing . i've had some headaches too , which is not like me .
[doctor] okay . are there any other symptoms ?
[patient] i've been noting some chilling sensations . i also get cold so easily . it's annoying . i feel like i have to really bundle up . i do n't know if this is related but my anxiety and depression feel like it has been getting worse lately . i feel like a mess .
[doctor] sounds like you're not feeling great , obviously . and i'm glad you came to see us . um , we're certainly going to try to figure this out and figure out what's going on , uh , but it sounds like you've been dealing with this anemia for a long time ?
[patient] yeah , i've been anemic since i was 13 years old .
[doctor] right . so why do your doctors think you're anemic ? do you have a history of heavy periods ?
[patient] well i did have heavy periods until i had a hysterectomy in 1996 . but no , they have not told me why they think i'm anemic , which is frustrating honestly .
[doctor] yeah . i can imagine that is . um , let's see if we can help though . since you had your hysterectomy your periods , of course , are no longer the issue . um , when was your last colonoscopy ?
[patient] about five to six years ago .
[doctor] and was it relatively a normal exam ? did you have any polyps ?
[patient] no . they said they'd see me in 10 years .
[doctor] well that's good news .
[patient] yeah , i agree .
[doctor] um , do you have a pacemaker or defibrillator , or have sleep apnea , or use oxygen at night ?
[patient] no .
[doctor] all right . do you ever drink alcohol ?
[patient] yeah , but only once or twice a year .
[doctor] okay . are you taking any supplements such as iron or vitamin b12 ?
[patient] i already started taking my iron pills which i have not taken in about a year .
[doctor] all right . and what are you taking ?
[patient] i'm taking 25 milligram tablets , twice daily .
[doctor] okay , and that's the , the ferrous sulfate ?
[patient] yeah , that's it . i take one in the morning and one in the evening .
[doctor] okay . anything else ?
[patient] yeah , i take vitamin b12 , just the over the counter stuff .
[doctor] okay , very good . all right , well let's go ahead and take a look and see what's going on .
[patient] sounds good . thank you .
[doctor] of course . you'll hear me , uh , talk through your exam so that i get all the information documented .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] all right . so use my general physical exam template . i will start by listening to your heart and lungs .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] all right . next , i'd like you to lay back so i can examine your abdomen .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] is there any tenderness where i'm pressing ?
[patient] no .
[doctor] okay . you can sit up . so your physical exam is normal without any significant findings . all right ms. cooper , often when we initially see anemia and your host of symptoms , we suspect internal bleeding .
[patient] is that why they want me to have another upper endoscopy ?
[doctor] actually it would be an upper endoscopy and a colonoscopy , but yes , likely that's the reason why .
[patient] lovely .
[doctor] yeah . unfortunately our cameras do not meet all the way in the middle , so if those tests back , come , if those tests come back fine , then we'll have you swallow a pill camera to take pictures as it moves through your , uh , system .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] we may not need to , but it's just the first thing we can do to make sure that you're not losing blood . um , the second thing we can do is have you see a hematologist . they will tell us if you need to give any , to give you any intravenous iron , or maybe something to help your body store the iron better .
[patient] all right .
[doctor] so let's go ahead , get your upper endoscopy and colonoscopy scheduled .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] um , have you ever had any issue with sedation in the past ?
[patient] no , i was just sleepy afterwards .
[doctor] okay . well we will give you a bowel prep to clean out your bowels ahead of time . um , if we do these tests and they are normal , like i said , then we will consider that capsule endoscopy .
[patient] okay . sounds like a plan .
[doctor] all right . so after that you'll be all done and we will send you to the hematologist . additionally , i'm going to need you to start taking your iron pills with orange juice . uh , the vitamin c will help you absorb the iron better . do this for about 8-12 weeks , uh , and then we can reassess your blood work .
[patient] okay , that sounds great .
[doctor] all right . well i think we have our plan . on your way out , stop by and schedule your upper endoscopy and c- colonoscopy . uh , we will send a referral to dr. flores who is is the hematologist , so schedule that appointment . um , here are your instructions for the pre- uh , the bowel prep . uh , call us if you have any questions or worsening symptoms . we'll be happy to help you .
[patient] thank you .
[doctor] you're welcome . have a great day , have a great day ms. cooper .
[patient] you too .
[doctor] all right . this is christina cooper , pleasant 65 year old female who was diagnosed with iron deficiency anemia in 12-2019 , and w- and was unable to donate blood . um , her followup blood work on 01/20/20 was revealed a low hemoglobin , stable hematocrit and normal iron labs , although ferritin was low . um , she was taking ferrous sulfate , three hundred , twenty phil- 25 milligrams by mouth . i've asked her to continue each dose with vitamin c found in orange juice , for the next 12 weeks , then recheck to the cbc , iron , ferritin , b12 , and folate . um , a referral was sent to her hematologist . we will plan for an egd and a colonoscopy to assess for potential sources of anemia or gi bleed . if this is inconclusive , capsule endoscopy will be considered . thanks .",2609.5,"Ferrous Sulfate 25 mg tablet twice per day (1 in the morning, 1 in the evening), Vitamin B12 OTC.",gemma_result,"Sure, here are all listed out for you in order as stated by text within that transcript about her current medication use :  the iron pills (ferrous sulfate) and vitaminer B12 supplements",0.6,Bin 1

MEDICAL NOTE:

CHIEF COMPLAINT

Tick bite.

MEDICAL HISTORY

Patient reports a history of arthritis, hypertension, and diabetes type 2.

SOCIAL HISTORY

Patient reports he enjoys spending time outside in the woods and working in the yard. He went hunting with his grandchildren a couple of weeks ago.

MEDICATIONS

Patient reports taking lisinopril 20 mg once a day and metformin 1000 mg twice daily most of the time.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Constitutional: Reports general ill feelings. Denies any fever, chills, flu like symptoms, body aches, or trouble waking.
Respiratory: Denies cough or shortness of breath.
Musculoskeletal: Denies joint pain or problems with ambulation.
Skin: Reports warmth on the right knee.
Neurological: Reports headache. Denies dizziness.

VITALS

Blood Pressure: 122/70 mmHg.
Heart Rate: 67 beats per minute.
Body Temperature: 98.4 degrees F.

PHYSICAL EXAM

Neck
- General Examination: Neck is supple without thyromegaly or lymphadenopathy.

Respiratory
- Auscultation of Lungs: Clear bilaterally.

Cardiovascular
- Auscultation of Heart: Regular rate and rhythm. No murmurs, gallops or rubs.

Musculoskeletal
- Examination of the right knee: Erythema and edema as well as an area of fluctuance noted over the right patella. There is pain to palpation of the right anterior knee. Full range of motion.

Integumentary
- Examination: There is evidence of a bull’s eye rash over the right knee.

RESULTS

Patient's previous kidney function is within normal limits.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

1. Tick bite.
- Medical Reasoning: My concern is that he might have Lyme disease based on the presentation of his right knee.
- Patient Education and Counseling: The patient and I discussed blood testing to determine if he does in fact have Lyme disease. I explained that Lyme disease can cause problems with other organs if not treated appropriately. We discussed that sometimes antibiotics need to be administered intravenously if oral antibiotics are not given early enough. We will see how he does with a course of oral antibiotics as I would like to avoid intravenous antibiotics.
- Medical Treatment: Prescription for doxycycline 100 mg twice a day for 3 weeks provided. Lyme titer and Western blot will be obtained to determine if he has Lyme disease.

2. Hypertension.
- Medical Reasoning: This is well-controlled at this time.
- Patient Education and Counseling: The patient and I discussed that he is doing really well monitoring his blood pressure at home.
- Medical Treatment: Continue lisinopril 20 mg once a day. Lipid panel ordered to assess his cholesterol levels.

3. Diabetes type 2.
- Medical Reasoning: He is doing a good job managing his diabetes since his blood sugars are running in the 120s. I do not think we need to make any adjustments, but we will see what the hemoglobin A1c shows as that gives us an idea of what his blood sugars are doing on a long-term basis.
- Patient Education and Counseling: We discussed that metformin can affect kidney function; however, his kidney function was last checked 2 months ago, and it has remained within normal limits.
- Medical Treatment: Continue metformin 1000 mg twice a day. Hemoglobin A1c ordered. Basic metabolic panel ordered to assess kidney function. 

Patient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.

[doctor] okay there is pain to palpation of the right anterior knee and i'm just gon na bend your knee up and down does that hurt at all
[patient] no no it's just more of the typical grinding that i would feel
[doctor] okay there is full range of motion of the right knee and on skin examination there is evidence of a bull's-eye rash over the right knee okay so what does that mean richard so that means that you know you do have some area of some inflammation over the over the right knee where you where you have that tick bite and you do have what we call that bull's eye rash which is what we get concerned about with with lyme disease so let's just talk a little bit about you know my assessment and my plan for you okay so for this first problem of your of your tick bite my concern is that you might have lyme disease based on the presentation of your right knee so i'm gon na go ahead and start you on doxycycline one hundred milligrams twice a day
[patient] we're gon na continue that for about three weeks i'm also gon na go ahead and send a lyme titer as well as a western blot to see if you do in fact have lyme lyme disease and we'll have to go ahead and just see how you do with this we you know i'd like to avoid intravenous antibiotics which i think we can avoid but i wanted to see how you do so
[doctor] do you have any questions about that
[patient] yeah i did n't know what those last two things or just
[doctor] yeah so so we are gon na start you on some antibiotics to help help you with this
[patient] you know possible lyme disease and i'm gon na just order some blood tests just to see exactly what's going on and then you know sometimes people need intravenous antibiotics because lyme disease can cause problems on other organs like your heart that type of thing
[doctor] if not treated appropriately and sometimes we need to give antibiotics through the iv which i'd like to avoid i think that we got this early enough that we can just treat you with some oral antibiotics okay for your second problem of your hypertension you know i think you're doing a really good job let's go ahead and continue you on the lisinopril twenty milligrams once a day and i wan na just go ahead and order a lipid panel just to make sure that everything is okay with your cholesterol how does that sound
[patient] that's fine
[doctor] great and then for your third problem of your diabetes i wan na just go ahead and order a hemoglobin a1c and continue you on the metformin one thousand milligrams twice a day it sounds like you're doing a good job since your blood sugars are running in the one twenties i do n't think we need to make any adjustments but we'll see what the hemoglobin a1c shows that gives us a an idea of what your blood sugars are doing on a long-term basis how does that sound
[patient] okay at what point time do you start kinda checking kidney function i've been told that metformin can possibly cause some kidney issues
[doctor] so it can you know your kidney function we've you know i think you've been really lucky it's been normal i checked it about two months ago and it looks pretty good it looks pretty normal but since we're doing blood work on you i can go ahead and order a a basic metabolic panel just to make sure that your kidney function is stable
[patient] okay that'd be good
[doctor] okay anything else
[patient] not that i can think of at this time as soon as i leave
[doctor] well you know where to find me okay
[patient] alright

MEDICAL NOTE:

CHIEF COMPLAINT

Right-sided abdominal pain

MEDICAL HISTORY

Patient reports history of kidney stones.

FAMILY HISTORY

Patient reports his father has a history of kidney stones.

MEDICATIONS

Patient reports use of Tylenol.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Gastrointestinal: Reports right-sided abdominal pain and nausea. Denies vomiting
Genitourinary: Reports dysuria and dark colored urine. Denies hematuria.

PHYSICAL EXAM

Gastrointestinal
- Examination of Abdomen: No masses or tenderness to palpation. No rebound or guarding. No peritoneal signs. Positive CVA tenderness on the right flank.

RESULTS

Previous CT scan of the abdomen ordered by the patient's PCP is reviewed and demonstrates a 0.5 cm kidney stone located in the proximal right ureter. There is no evidence of hydronephrosis.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

1. Acute nephrolithiasis.
- Medical Reasoning: The patient presents with complaints of right-sided abdominal pain. His previous CT scan was reviewed and demonstrates a 0.5 cm kidney stone located in the proximal right ureter without evidence of hydronephrosis.
- Medical Treatment: I have recommended that he push fluids in order to help facilitate urination to help pass the stone. He will be provided with a strainer to allow us to potentially test the stone if he is able to pass it. I have also prescribed oxycodone 5 mg every 6 to 8 hours as needed for pain. He can continue to alternate oxycodone with Tylenol. A basic metabolic panel, urinalysis, and urine culture will also be ordered.

INSTRUCTIONS

He will follow up in 1 to 2 weeks. If he is still having symptoms at that time, we will discuss further treatment such as lithotripsy or ureteroscopy. He is to contact me if he is having worsening symptoms over the next week.

[patient] well i've been having this sharp pain on the right side of my abdomen below my ribs for the last several days
[doctor] i saw my doctor and they ordered a cat scan and said i had a kidney stone and sent me to see a urologist okay well does the pain move or or or go anywhere or does it stay right in that same spot yeah it feels like it goes to my lower abdomen in into my groin okay and is the pain constant or does it come and go it comes and goes when it comes it's it's pretty it's pretty bad i feel like i ca n't find a comfortable position okay and do you notice any any pain when you urinate or when you pee
[patient] yeah it kinda burns a little bit
[doctor] okay do you notice any blood i do n't think there is any you know frank blood but the urine looks a little dark sometimes okay and what have you taken for the pain i have taken some tylenol but it has n't really helped okay and do you have any nausea vomiting any fever chills i feel nauseated but i'm not vomiting okay is anyone in your in your family had kidney stones yes my father had them and have you had kidney stones before yeah so i i've i've had them but i've been able to pass them but this is taking a lot longer okay well i'm just gon na go ahead and do a physical examination i'm gon na be calling out some of my exam findings and i'm going to explain what what those mean when i'm done okay
[patient] okay
[doctor] okay so on physical examination of the abdomen on a abdominal exam there is no tenderness to palpation there is no evidence of any rebound or guarding there is no peritoneal signs there is positive cva tenderness on the right flank so essentially what that means russell is that you know you have some tenderness over your over your right kidney and that just means that you might have some inflammation there so i i reviewed the results of the ct scan of your abdomen that the primary care doctor ordered and it does show a . five centimeter kidney stone located in the proximal right ureter so this the ureter is the duct in which urine passes between the kidney and the bladder there's no evidence of what we call hydronephrosis this means you know swelling of the kidney which is good means that things are still able to get through so let's talk a little bit about my assessment and my plan okay so for your first problem of this acute nephrolithiasis or kidney stone i i wan na go ahead and recommend that you push fluids to help facilitate urination and peeing to help pass the stone i'm going to prescribe oxycodone five milligrams every six to eight hours as needed for pain you can continue to alternate that with some tylenol i'm going to give you a strainer that you can use to strain your urine so that we can see it see the stone when it passes and we can send it for some some tests if that happens i'm also gon na order what we call a basic metabolic panel a urinalysis and a urine culture now i wan na see you again in one to two weeks and if you're still having symptoms we'll have to discuss further treatment such as lithotripsy which is essentially a shock wave procedure in which we sedate you and use shock waves to break up the stone to help it pass we could also do what we call a ureteroscopy which is a small telescope small camera used to go up to to the urethra and bladder and up into the ureter to retrieve the stone so let's see how you do over the next week and i want you to contact me if you're having worsening symptoms okay okay sounds good thank you",911.0,Patient reports use of Tylenol.,gemma_result,"Sure, here are some of his current meds as stated in this transcript excerpts (some info has been omitted for brevity):

Gender: female
Chief Complaint: Left knee pain
Secondary Complaints: hypertension;type 2 diabetes

---------------------------------------------
MEDICAL NOTE:

CHIEF COMPLAINT

Left knee pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Andrea Barnes is a 34-year-old female who presents today for evaluation of left knee pain.

The patient has been experiencing intermittent episodes of pain and sudden instability with ambulation. Her pain is localized deep in her patella and occurs less than once daily. Due to the fleeting nature of these episodes, she has not taken medication and simply braces herself until it passes. She denies any trauma or injury, or ever hearing or feeling a pop in the knee. Her symptoms do not interfere with her daily activities and she does not use a cane.

Regarding her hypertension, it has been several days since she last checked her blood pressure at home, but it was approximately 120/70 mmHg at that time. Her current medications include amlodipine, lisinopril, and hydrochlorothiazide, all of which she takes on a regular basis.

In terms of her diabetes, her fasting morning blood glucose levels have been approximately 130 based on home monitoring. This is slightly higher than usual, even though she has been compliant with metformin and Farxiga. She does try to avoid eating late at night.

MEDICAL HISTORY

Patient reports a personal history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes.

SOCIAL HISTORY

Patient likes to travel and is planning a trip to Columbus, Georgia in the next month or so. She is part of the Lion's Club.

MEDICATIONS

Patient reports that she is taking amlodipine, lisinopril 20 mg once daily, hydrochlorothiazide, Metformin, and Farxiga.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Musculoskeletal: Reports left knee pain and instability,

VITALS

Temperature: 98.2 degrees F
Heart rate: 72 bpm
Respirations: 16
Blood pressure: 122/70 mmHg

PHYSICAL EXAM

MSK: Examination of the right knee: No ecchymosis or edema. No effusion. No pain with palpation.
Examination of the left knee: Full range of motion. Negative varus and valgus stress test.

RESULTS

X-rays were obtained and reviewed today. These reveal no evidence of fracture or bony abnormality.

ASSESSMENT

1. Left knee pain.
2. Hypertension.
3. Diabetes mellitus type 2.

PLAN

After reviewing the patients x-rays, I believe there is some arthritis in the knee. I'm going to prescribe meloxicam 15 mg once daily. We can consider physical therapy to strengthen the muscles around the area to prevent any further issues.

Her hypertension is well controlled with her current medication regimen. She can continue with lisinopril 20 mg once daily. I'm also going to order an echocardiogram for further evaluation of the murmur heard on exam.

She has been compliant with metformin as prescribed, but her blood glucose levels have been slightly elevated recently. I'm going to order a lipid panel, as well as a hemoglobin A1c to determine if any adjustments need to be made to her dose of metformin.

---------------------------------------------","[doctor] okay hi andrea well i
[patient] hello
[doctor] i understand you're you've come in with some right knee pain can you tell me about it what's going on

[doctor] is that where you would be kicking your leg out or something
[patient] no it's do n't you know what line dancing is like dancing in theories of fairly fast moves but it's mostly sideways motion
[doctor] and is and that you think that's when your knee might give out then or just not gon na take the chance
[patient] not gon na take the chance
[doctor] okay yeah that sounds like a good idea have you thought about even having a a cane just in case or do you think that's does that happen often enough

[doctor] is that in the morning when you're fasting
[patient] yes
[doctor] okay
[patient] and i have been told that sometimes the morning blood sugars are higher for some reason but i do n't know i i do n't really worry about it as long as it does n't get up too extremely high so
[doctor] and are you taking your metformin
[patient] yes yes that's along with the blood pressure medicine morning and night
[doctor] okay alright so are you are you eating like late at night or anything like that

[patient] okay
[doctor] for the diabetes mellitus i wan na order a hemoglobin a1c to see if we need to make any adjustments to your metformin and i'm also gon na order a lipid panel okay do you have any questions

[patient] it hurts like in , in , in the inside of my knee .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] right here .
[doctor] all right . and anything make it better or worse ?
[patient] i have been putting ice on it , uh , and i've been taking ibuprofen , but it does n't seem to help much .
[doctor] okay . so it sounds like you fell a couple days ago , and you've hurt something inside of your right knee .
[patient] mm-hmm .
[doctor] and you've been taking a little bit of ice , uh , putting some ice on it , and has n't really helped and some ibuprofen . is that right ?
[patient] that's right . yeah .
[doctor] okay , let's review your past history for a second . it looks like , uh , do you have any other past medical history ?
[patient] uh , afib .
[doctor] okay , and are you taking any medications for that ?
[patient] yeah , i am . um , begins with a d.
[doctor] uh , digoxin ?
[patient] that's it . yeah , that's it .
[doctor] okay , all right . how about any surgeries in the past ?
[patient] i have had a nose job .
[doctor] all right . um , let's do your exam , okay ? so is it tender ... where is it mostly tender right now ?
[patient] right on the inside of my knee . right here .
[doctor] all right , so if i bend your knee forward , does that seem to hurt ?
[patient] yes , that hurts .
[doctor] all right , how about if i twist it a little bit that way .
[patient] that hurts a lot .
[doctor] okay , okay . and how about down here ? do you feel me touch you down here ?
[patient] yes .
[doctor] all right . any other pain down here in your calves ?
[patient] no .
[doctor] no , okay . so on exam you do have some tenderness over the medial portion of your knee over the medial meniscus area . uh , there is no , uh , there is a little bit of tenderness when i flex your , uh , when i , uh , uh , do some valgus stressing on your , on your leg . um , you have normal sensation . so let's take a look at your x-rays .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] okay . hey dragon , show me the x-rays . so looking at the x-ray , um , of your left knee , uh , it appears to be there's no fractures there right now . i do n't see any , uh , there's a little bit of , uh , fluid , uh , but there is no , uh , there's no , um , fracture or there's no dislocation . everything else seems to be lined up properly , okay ?
[patient] okay .
[doctor] so in summary after my exam , uh , looking at your knee , uh , on the x-ray and your exam , you have some tenderness over the medial meniscus , so i think you have probably an acute medial meniscus sprain right now or strain . uh , at this point , my recommendation would be to put you in a knee brace , uh , and we'll go ahead and have you use some crutches temporarily for the next couple days . we'll have you come back in about a week and see how you're doing , and if it's not better , we'll get an mri at that time .

MEDICAL NOTE:

CHIEF COMPLAINT

Left foot pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Jean Martinez is a pleasant 27-year-old female who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of left foot pain.

The patient sustained an injury to her left foot while playing soccer yesterday. She became entangled with another player, causing the player to fall onto the patient's foot, resulting in immediate pain. After the incident, she required help to get off of the field and was unable to participate for the rest of the game. Her trainer wrapped her foot, and she has tried ice, elevation, and ibuprofen to treat her symptoms. with medication, she rates her pain as 3/10, but without medication her pain is rated as 7-8/10. There is no numbness, tingling, or other abnormal sensations associated with her pain.

Of note, the patient has sustained several injuries in the past while playing soccer, but this is her first left foot injury.

MEDICAL HISTORY

The patient reports that she has sustained several soccer injuries in the past.

SOCIAL HISTORY

The patient has been playing soccer since she was 4 or 5 years old. She is currently playing in a local league.

MEDICATIONS

The patient reports that she has been taking ibuprofen.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Musculoskeletal: Reports left foot pain.
Neurological: Denies left foot numbness or tingling.

VITALS

Blood pressure: 118/72 mmHg
Heart rate: 58 bpm
Respiratory rate: 14
Temperature: Afebrile
Oxygen saturation: 99% on room air

PHYSICAL EXAM

CV: Regular rate and rhythm without clicks, rubs, or murmurs. No ectopic beats noted on auscultation of the heart. Brisk capillary refill, less than 3 seconds. Dorsalis pedis pulse is intact and strong.
RESPIRATORY: Lungs are clear and equal bilaterally.
NEURO: Motor and sensation in the left foot are intact to light touch.
MSK: Examination of the left foot: Ecchymosis on the plantar and dorsal aspects of the foot. Associated swelling. Tenderness to palpation of the midfoot. Positive piano key test.

RESULTS

X-ray images of the left foot were obtained and reviewed today. These reveal subtle dorsal displacement of the base of the 2nd metatarsal with a 3 mm separation of the 1st and 2nd metatarsal bases. There is presence of a bony fragment in the Lisfranc joint space.

ASSESSMENT

Lisfranc fracture, left foot.

PLAN

I explained the nature of her injury in detail. Based on her exam and x-ray findings, she will most likely require surgery of the left foot, but I want to order an MRI to assess for any ligamentous injuries. We discussed the procedure and postoperative expectations, such as recovery time and restrictions, at length. We also discussed the complications associated with deferring surgical intervention including poor bone and ligament healing, pes planus deformation, and a high likelihood of developing arthritis in the foot. She will be unable to participate for the remainder of the soccer season, but should be able to play next season.

INSTRUCTIONS

We will see the patient on Monday, for surgery.

---------------------------------------------","[doctor] hey jean how're you doing today
[patient] i'm doing alright aside from this foot pain that i have
[doctor] so i see here that you looks like you hurt your left foot here where you were playing soccer can you tell me a little bit more about what happened
[patient] yeah so yeah i was playing in a soccer game yesterday and i was trying to steal the ball from another player and she ended up falling directly onto my right foot and i do n't know i i mean i was trying to get around her and my body ended up twisting around her and then i accidentally felt a pain in my foot
[doctor] okay so have you ever hurt your left foot before
[patient] no i've had a lot of injuries in soccer but never injured this foot
[doctor] okay and then so after the fall and the entanglement with the other player were you able to continue playing
[patient] no i had to stop playing right away and actually being helped off the field
[doctor] wow okay and what have you been doing for the the pain since then
[patient] so i've been keeping it elevated icing it the trainer wrapped it yesterday and taking ibuprofen as well
[doctor] okay alright so without any ibuprofen can you tell me what your pain level is
[patient] without ibuprofen i would say my pain is a three
[doctor] okay and then with your ibuprofen can you tell me what your pain level is
[patient] like a seven eight
[doctor] okay so how long have you been playing soccer
[patient] really since i was like four five i've been playing a long time
[doctor] well that's cool yeah we our our youngest daughter she is almost sixteen and she plays the inner marrial soccer league they are down at the rex center did is that where you started playing or did you guys did you start playing somewhere else
[patient] yeah just like this local town leak i started playing that way and then played all throughout school
[doctor] that's
[patient] high school teams
[doctor] that's awesome so just out of curiosity with the left foot have you experienced anything like numbness or tingling or or any strange sensation
[patient] no i have not
[doctor] okay now if it's okay with you i would like to do a quick physical exam i reviewed your vitals and everything looks good blood pressure was one eighteen over seventy two heart rate was fifty eight respiratory rate was fourteen you are afebrile and you had an o2 saturation of ninety nine percent on room air on your heart exam your regular of rate and rhythm do n't appreciate any clicks rubs or murmurs no ectopic beats noted there on auscultation listening to your lungs lungs are clear and equal bilaterally so you're moving good air i'd like to do a focused foot exam on your left foot so i do see some bruising on the bottom of your foot and on the top of your foot as well now there is associated swelling and i do appreciate tenderness to palpation of your midfoot and you are positive for the piano key test on a neurovascular exam of your left foot you have a brisk capillary refill of less than three seconds dorsalis pedis pulse is intact and strong and you do have motor and sensation that it's intact to light touch now i would like to do a review of the diagnostic imaging that you had before you came in so i do notice a subtle dorsal displacement of the base of the second metatarsal with a three millimeter separation of the first and second metatarsal bases and the presence of a bony fragment in the lisfranc joint space so lem me talk to you a little bit about my assessment and plan now for for the first concern of right foot pain your right foot pain is due to a lisfranc fracture which is a fracture to one of your second metatarsal bones at the top of your foot where the metatarsals meet your cuboids now there are ligaments at the top of your foot so i'm gon na be ordering an mri to assess for injury to any of these ligaments now based on your exam and from what i'm seeing on your x-ray you're most likely going to need surgery of that foot now the surgery will place the bones back in their proper position and using plates and screws will hold them there while they heal and this is gon na allow those bones and ligaments to heal properly it is a day surgery and you will be able to go home the same day and then i'm going to have you follow up with me here in the clinic you'll be in a cast and you will need to use crutches and you will not be able to use that left foot for about six to eight weeks now after that six to eight weeks you will gradually start walking on your foot based on how you tolerate it and we'll see how you do at that point so i do believe you're gon na need surgery i i'm recommending this because there are significant complications to your foot if we do not do this poor bone and ligament healing can lead to losing the arch of your foot and you're becoming flat-footed you also have a high likelihood of developing arthritis in that foot so what i'm gon na do unfortunately you'll be out the rest of the season but we are gon na get you fixed up and ready for next season if you're okay with all of this i'm gon na have the nurse come in and get you started on your paperwork and then i will see you on monday morning and we will get your foot taken care of

MEDICAL NOTE:

CHIEF COMPLAINT

Bilateral elbow pain, right worse than left.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Dylan Bennett is a pleasant 53-year-old male who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of bilateral elbow pain, right worse than left.

The patient has been experiencing bilateral elbow pain, right worse than left, for approximately 1.5 years. His pain is localized to the medial aspect of his elbows and is described as being extremely sore, worse with increased use of his upper extremities. Of note, he utilizes heavy weights for strength training and was very active in sports when he was younger, primarily playing basketball, baseball, and football, but he denies having any pain at that time. Applying ice to the area has not been helpful, but he does use ibuprofen 800 mg 3 times daily.

SOCIAL HISTORY

The patient reports that utilizes heavy weights for strength training. He was also very active in sports when he was younger, primarily playing basketball, baseball, and football.

He is expecting a newborn baby in the near future.

MEDICATIONS

The patient reports that he has been taking ibuprofen 800 mg 3 times daily.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Musculoskeletal: Reports bilateral elbow pain, right worse than left.

PHYSICAL EXAM

CV: Pulses are equal in all extremities.
NEURO: Sensation is normal to light touch distally.
MSK: 
Examination of the right elbow: Limited range of motion with extension with pain. Full range of motion with flexion with pain. Pain to palpation along the medial aspect. No pain to palpation on the lateral aspect of the elbow. Pain with supination. No pain with pronation.
Examination of the left elbow: minimal pain with flexion and extension Slight Limited ROM on extension of the arm. Pain with supination. No pain with pronation.

RESULTS

X-ray images of the bilateral elbows were obtained and review in office today. These reveal no evidence of fracture or bony misalignment.

ASSESSMENT

Bilateral medial epicondylitis.

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, we had a lengthy discussion in regards to his current symptoms. I want to get an MRI of the bilateral elbows for further evaluation. We discussed the possibility of performing a whole blood transfusion to encourage healing, and the patient is already familiar with this procedure.

---------------------------------------------","[doctor] hey dylan what's going on so i lift quite a bit of weights i try to stay in shape as much as i can i'm not like normal people i lift heavy weights and my elbow is extremely sore which elbow is it

[patient] correct
[doctor] alright so dylan it took some x-rays coming in looks like you do n't have any any fractures or any bony misalignment which i expect with this kind of injury i do think that what you have is medial epicondylitis which is
[patient] is that golfer's elbow
[doctor] yes same thing have you been golfing a lot
[patient] well not in the past year and a half i've had this for a long time
[doctor] okay also known as pictures elbow

[doctor] that will be our next step so we'll get you scheduled for the mri probably get you in pretty quick here since we're a private practice
[patient] thank god
[doctor] yeah and once you get the mri i'll know a little bit more what i'd like to do is something called a whole blood transfusion have you heard of that before
[patient] no please tell me remind me
[doctor] yeah it should help with the healing of your elbow it's just a procedure we'll stick a needle in your elbow
[patient] you do a stick needle in my elbow
[doctor] mm-hmm and help with some of the healing of your elbow
[patient] so it's kinda like dry needling then
[doctor] no
[patient] not at all
[doctor] what is it
[patient] is it is that that thing where like you take the blood out of like say my my thigh
[doctor] mm-hmm
[patient] and then you literally inject it into my tendon
[doctor] yes
[patient] that it activates the healing
[doctor] yeah that's exactly what it is
[patient] interesting cool
[doctor] yeah
[patient] maybe i have heard about that
[doctor] we've we've had some really good responses from other patients on it so hopefully i mean that should be a good solution for you since you've been having issues with this
[patient] i'm excited
[doctor] yeah and we can hopefully get you scheduled for that in the next couple of weeks it's not not a major procedure and you should heal in the next two weeks so that wo n't be a problem especially considering that you're expecting a newborn soon we want to make sure you're all healed for that
[patient] wow i did n't even say that

Musculoskeletal
- Examination: Trace lower extremity edema.

RESULTS

Echocardiogram reveals a preserved ejection fraction of 55%, abnormal diastolic filling, and mild-to-moderate mitral regurgitation.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

1. Congestive heart failure.
- Medical Reasoning: This appears to have been caused by dietary indiscretion and uncontrolled hypertension.
- Patient Education and Counseling: I encouraged the patient to continue making dietary modifications, including limiting her sodium intake. She could try keeping a food diary, as previously discussed, to log her diet and associated blood pressure readings. I also advised her to monitor her weight daily and contact me if she gains 3 pounds in 2 days.
- Medical Treatment: Continue with Bumex 2 mg once daily. Referral placed for consult with a nutritionist for education and recommendations regarding her diet.

2. Hypertension.
- Medical Reasoning: This has been poorly controlled due to inconsistent compliance with medication and dietary indiscretion.
- Patient Education and Counseling: We discussed dietary modifications as noted above.
- Medical Treatment: She can continue on Cozaar 100 mg daily and Norvasc 5 mg once daily. Renal artery ultrasound ordered to rule out any issues such as renal artery stenosis.

3. Kidney disease.
- Medical Treatment: Labs will be ordered to assess her response to new medications.

Patient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.

INSTRUCTIONS

The patient will follow up in 3 months.

Age: 40.0
Gender: female 
Chief Complaint: follow-up bilateral breast cysts
Secondary Complaints: anxiety; itchiness

---------------------------------------------
MEDICAL NOTE:

CHIEF COMPLAINT

Follow-up bilateral breast cysts.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Donna Torres is a 40-year-old female who presents for follow-up surveillance of bilateral breast cysts.

The patient reports continual presence of “lumps” in bilateral breasts with some soreness. She is being seen today for surveillance of the cysts. The patient is taking progesterone, which was initially prescribed to support normalization of menstruation, which was effective. She is also still using vaginal cream one time per week which has improved symptoms of itching and discomfort.

Her last pap smear was in 2019, with negative/negative results. She did have an abnormal pap smear in 2009, which resulted in repeat pap smears per 6 months until her results normalized.

Mrs. Torres experienced increased anxiety in 11/2021 and 12/2021, stating “it was brutal” and felt she could not manage her symptoms and sought treatment. Dr. Brown started the patient on Buspar, which has successfully controlled her anxiety. The patient relates her anxiety to work related stress and possibly aging. Her work involves supporting Covid evaluation centers and clinics. She confirms receiving both Covid vaccinations. Initially, she was experiencing spikes in anxiety prior to menstruation, but her anxiety then became more random with an unclear cause. To note, the patient was started on Singulair, which the patient was told could also cause anxiety.

The patient discontinued Camila birth control, which did result in a significant increase in appetite. This has resolved and she reports she has lost weight in the past 6 months.

---------------------------------------------","[doctor] donna torres , date of birth , 08/01/1980 .
[doctor] hi donna ! how are you ?
[patient] i'm good . how about you ?
[doctor] i'm doing well , thank you . and so , i saw that dr. brown put you on buspar . have you been on that before ?
[patient] no , that's new .
[doctor] okay . how is it working for you ?
[patient] my anxiety is going good now , thankfully . i'm serious , it was brutal in november and december . finally , i was like , "" i can not do this . "" i have no idea why it happened . dr. ward did put me on singulair , and she did say we need to be careful because singulair can cause anxiety . so i'm not sure if that was the issue or what .
[doctor] mm . okay .
[patient] and it would , um , start usually during the day , at work .
[doctor] i see .
[patient] i mean , i'm fine now .
[doctor] well , that's good , that things have settled . i do wonder if some of what you are dealing with is hormonal , and that's why i was asking . 'cause you were on the progesterone , and i feel like you were having some irritability back then too .
[patient] i did .
[doctor] and that was before we started the progesterone .
[patient] yes .
[doctor] so i know we started it for regulating your periods , but perhaps it helped with this also .
[patient] yeah . and before , in november and december , i noticed that the week before my period , my anxiety would go through the roof . which then , i knew my period was coming . then it turned into my anxiety spiking just at random times .
[doctor] hmm , okay .
[patient] and it seemed like it was for no reason .
[doctor] but november and december you were on the progesterone at that time .
[patient] yes .
[doctor] all right . so not really a link there , all right .
[patient] yeah , i do n't know .
[doctor] yeah , i do n't know either . um , sometimes with the aging process , that can happen too .
[patient] i figured maybe that's what it was .
[doctor] and we did go through the golive in november and december , so that can be pretty stressful also .
[patient] yeah , and at work , that's when i first started to lead the process of delivering the results to patients with covid . in the beginning of the whole pandemic , patients would have to wait nine days before they'd get their results . and then we opened the evaluation centers and the covid clinic . so i think it just took a toll on me .
[doctor] yeah , i can absolutely see that .
[patient] yeah , and then i was feeling selfish because i was n't even on the front lines . i mean , i was supporting people , sure , but i was n't in the icu . so i felt selfish and guilty . i mean , hands down , the physicians and nurses were in the thick of it and there i was , having anxiety . and it felt ridiculous .
[doctor] well , honestly , you feel how you feel and what you were doing was n't easy as well , so ... but let's see . i need to just put this dax back to work . all right , so no other issues whatsoever ?
[patient] no .
[doctor] have you lost weight ?
[patient] no , but i stopped taking the camila birth control . my hunger level was at a new high . i mean , i was eating constantly . i felt like , "" what is going on ? ""
[doctor] all right .
[patient] and now i am feeling better .
[doctor] okay , that's good . and your masked face , though , it does look thinner .
[patient] well , the past six months i have lost some weight .
[doctor] okay , good . um , anything else going on ?
[patient] no .
[doctor] all right . so your pap was in 2019 . i do n't think that we need to repeat that because it was negative/negative . um , have you ever had an abnormal pap ?
[patient] not with you , but i did around 2009 , and then i had to be seen every six months for a while . and then i had a normal pap .
[doctor] all right , well , let's just repeat it then .
[patient] yeah , that's fine with me , to be safe .
[doctor] okay . i know it sounds superstitious , but i feel like with all the immunocompromising , the pressure , the stress that people's bodies have been under , and the potential for getting covid or the vaccine ... i have actually seen some , um , an increase in abnormal paps in people who have been fine for a while . so that's why i figure let's just check .
[patient] okay . i fight the vaccine fight every day at home because my husband is n't ready to get it . same with my daughter . she shares the same worries as her dad in how it'll impact her when she gets older .
[doctor] have you had the vaccine ?
[patient] yes , i have . and so has my son . he , um , has had his first already .
[doctor] okay . well , you know , you can only do what you can do .
[patient] yeah , i agree .
[doctor] all right . well , let's complete your exam .
[patient] all right .
[doctor] so let's take a deep breath . and again . all right , you can breathe normally . all right , and take one more deep breath . okay , now i'm gon na touch your neck . go ahead and swallow . perfect . and just place your hand above your head . okay , i do feel some little bumps .
[patient] yeah , but they're not as big as they were .
[doctor] mm-hmm . okay , in this breast it does feel a little bit denser . does it hurt at all ?
[patient] it does , where your left hand just was .
[doctor] okay , right here ?
[patient] yeah , down here . but whenever i breastfed , it was always sore there too . i had a clog and something else . the lumps do feel smaller , but they are still there , unfortunately .
[doctor] yeah , they are . uh , well now i do n't know , because if it was the progesterone , they would've gone away .
[patient] yeah .
[doctor] all right , well just let your knees just op- relax and open . how's the itching or discomfort ? are you still using the cream ?
[patient] yes , and i actually need to get that refilled for the first time ever .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] uh , but yeah , i use it once a week and it does help .
[doctor] okay , great . all right , looks good .
[patient] good .
[doctor] you can go ahead and sit up .
[patient] thank you .
[doctor] all right , so typically the lumps would often just shrink up pretty quickly after you've had one or two cycles , and you've had two cycles so far . so i think let's just keep monitoring them for now .
[patient] okay . and what could that mean ?
[doctor] well , so just like people have an increased risk of breast cancer , there's also an increased risk for breast issues . you know what i mean ? so for example , cysts and lumps and fibroadenomas , those are all benign things . they're annoying and require some workup , but they're all benign .
[patient] and i'm- i'm just worried because i'm almost 40 and my mom was almost 45 when she was diagnosed with breast cancer . so i mean , i know there's nothing i can do about it , but it's just i feel like , uh , we had it under control and now it is n't .
[doctor] well , i would n't say that . i mean , i feel like we're at a point where we have a good cadence for you having surveillance on things , and i think you are more aware of your breasts than ever before , and things actually have n't changed .
[patient] yeah .
[doctor] so those are all good things .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] because , um , if it was cancer , we'd actually , we would see some change .
[patient] we would ? okay , thank you for explaining that .
[doctor] yeah . so i know it's annoying and distressing , but i think that's where we're at . it's annoying that you have the breast issue , and it's annoying that we have to follow them .
[patient] yeah , i agree there .
[doctor] um , but the only extra that i could po- , uh , potentially do , is we could get a breast specialist on the team and have you start to follow with them . and one of the advantages there is that they sometimes will do an ultrasound as an extension of their physical exam , in the office , to check out it- check it out on their own . uh , they also have a lot more experience and more willingness to sometimes perform procedures earlier , if they think it needs , um , if they think it needs to be done . and i think they tend to be much quicker than , you know , like radiology as to biopsy it .
[patient] okay . i'll do whatever you think i should .
[doctor] all right . well , i think since you're feeling worried , let's go ahead and we can get them on board . i'll send out a referral and they will call you within the next couple of business days to schedule .
[patient] okay , i think that sounds great .
[doctor] all right . i do too . all right , well any questions or anything else we can discuss today ?
[patient] no , i think i'm all set .
[doctor] all right , good . all right , well have a good rest of your day and just give us a call if you need anything else .
[patient] all right , thank you . you have a good day too .

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

1. Asthma.
- Medical Reasoning: The patient has experienced an increased need to use her albuterol inhaler. She is not currently utilizing a daily medication. At this time, we will try a daily medication since it looks like she might be having some allergies.
- Patient Education and Counseling: I explained the side effects of albuterol to the patient. We also discussed Singulair and that she should start to see a difference in her breathing within approximately 1 month.
- Medical Treatment: We will start her on a daily asthma medication. She can continue to use the albuterol inhaler. We will start her on Singulair in about a month.

2. Mood.
- Medical Reasoning: The patient reports being under a lot of stress with school. I believe this may be attributing to her mood.
- Medical Treatment: I would like for the patient to be seen by a therapist. She will also complete our screening questionnaire.

Patient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.

INSTRUCTIONS

The patient will follow up in 6 weeks for recheck.

---------------------------------------------","[doctor] okay
[patient] good morning
[doctor] good morning thanks doctor doctor cooper i'm i'm you know i'm a little i'm sad to be in here but you know thanks for taking me in i appreciate it
[patient] sure absolutely what can i help you with today
[doctor] so you know i've been dealing with my asthma and like i tried to join sports but it's really kind of it's getting hard you know and i i i just wonder if there's something that can be done because i really do like playing water polo
[patient] but i'm having difficulty breathing sometimes i've had to like you know stop matches and sit on the side just to kind of like catch my breath and use my inhaler so i was wondering if there was something we could do about it
[doctor] and then like i'm kind of a little bit worried i think my mood is getting a little a little worrisome and i i wanted to explore like what my options were
[patient] okay let's talk about the asthma first so what inhaler are you using now
[doctor] i have an albuterol inhaler
[patient] okay and when when you're having trouble it's usually just around sports that is it keeping you up at night
[doctor] so i do n't really like wake up at night a lot typically like it's sports like you know if i'm doing anything like crazy aerobic or like running or anything i do notice that if any if i'm around smoke i do start coughing a little bit but most of the time it's sports
[patient] okay and can you describe a little bit for me what happens
[doctor] i start to yeah no so i start to feel like there is like some phlegm building up in my in my throat and i start coughing like my chest gets tight i start wheezing and i just have to sit down or else i'm gon na get like lightheaded too
[patient] okay and then when you use your inhaler
[doctor] mm-hmm
[patient] does it does it alleviate the problem
[doctor] so yeah it helps with that like phlegm feeling you know but i still i still have to sit down you know and like breathe and then the thing that i hate about that inhaler is i start getting like shaky is that supposed to be happening
[patient] yes that is unfortunately normal and a side effect with the inhaler
[doctor] okay
[patient] so you use you're using two puffs of the inhaler
[doctor] mm-hmm
[patient] for the symptoms
[doctor] yes
[patient] and then you sit down and does it does it get better within about fifteen minutes or so
[doctor] yeah yeah it does but you know i had to like step out of the the pool to make that happen i'm hoping that there is something else we can do okay have you ever taken any daily medications for your asthma an inhaler or singulair or anything like that no i i just use my inhaler whenever i have an attack
[patient] okay so that's something we might wan na consider but how often is it happening
[doctor] pretty much every time i do any kind of aerobic workout
[patient] okay and outside of physical activity you're not having any problems
[doctor] yeah there's that part where like if i'm around somebody who has been smoking a lot or is currently smoking but i usually just step away i do n't even like to be around them you know that makes sense
[patient] alright well we will look at that tell me about the mood issues you are having
[doctor] yeah so one of the reasons i got into like trying to get into sports is like i feel like you know you you feel a lot more energized and a lot you know happier but like lately i've just been kinda stressed out you know like i have i have like sats that i need to study for i've got like all these ap classes you know there's just it i feel like there's a lot of pressure and you know like i get it but there are times where i'm just like really down and i i do n't really know what else i can do
[patient] okay that makes sense any any difficulty with focusing or you're having difficulty retaining information or is it more feeling sad not having motivation
[doctor] so i think it's like a lot of sadness a lot of like you know i do n't really i kinda feel like you know i do n't really like want to do anything you know my friends will go out and i'll just be like i'd rather be at home i am really tired a lot too
[patient] okay alright well let me let me go ahead and check you out
[doctor] mm-hmm
[patient] and then we can talk a little bit more
[doctor] okay
[patient] i'm gon na take a listen to your heart and lungs
[doctor] mm-hmm
[patient] and everything sounds good
[doctor] let me take a look at your eyes
[patient] mm-hmm and in your ears everything looks okay have you had any problems with allergies you have seasonal allergies or anything like that
[doctor] yeah i think so yeah
[patient] i do see just a little bit of fluid in the ears
[doctor] mm-hmm
[patient] and i'm gon na look in your mouth too
[doctor] okay
[patient] and throat looks fine no tonsils
[doctor] mm-hmm
[patient] lem me go ahead and have you lay back on the table and i'll take a listen to your stomach
[doctor] okay
[patient] everything sounds okay i'm gon na feel around just to make sure everything feels normal
[doctor] mm-hmm
[patient] everything feels fine and i'm gon na check reflexes and they're all normal
[doctor] awesome
[patient] it's really hard to do with actual patient so in terms of the asthma i think we could try a daily medication since it looks like you might be having a little bit of allergies maybe we can try some singulair
[doctor] mm-hmm
[patient] and start with that once you are on that daily and you can continue to use the albuterol inhaler those side effects unfortunately you're right it's it's just one of the expected side effects with an albuterol inhaler i would recommend just what you're doing just sit down for a little bit after you take it
[doctor] and we will get you started on the singulair probably within about a month you should see a difference so i will have you come back in about six weeks and follow up and see how you're doing with that
[patient] in terms of the mood is this new for you
[doctor] yeah i think so like when i started this year
[patient] and it sounds like related to school expectations and the stress with saps and all of that
[doctor] yeah
[patient] okay let's consider having you start seeing a therapist i think that would be a good place to start
[doctor] mm-hmm
[patient] and we will do some screening questionnaires and and then follow up in a couple weeks on that too
[doctor] okay alright sounds like a plan okay

- Patient Education and Counseling: I discussed the diagnosis with the patient today. I explained that her headaches may be caused by tension around the muscles around her neck and shoulders. I advised her that her symptoms do not appear related to signs of a stroke or brain bleeding. Questions were asked and answered today.
- Medical Treatment: She can continue to take Tylenol for the pain. Prescription for Flexeril 5 mg 3 times a day is provided as well.

2. Diabetes mellitus.

- Patient Education and Counseling: We discussed the importance of maintaining a healthy lifestyle. We also discussed the importance of keeping a watchful eye on her blood sugar levels.
- Medical Treatment: She will continue taking metformin 500 mg daily. Order for hemoglobin A1c, CBC, and CMP provided today. She will check her blood sugar daily and will bring that information in on her next visit.

[patient] yes no just in the back of my head
[doctor] okay and did the headache start all of a sudden carolyn or has it been gradual or what

[patient] no i really do n't get the opportunity to
[doctor] hmmm okay understood alright well listen let's go ahead and examine you okay so so on your physical exam your physical exam is pretty normal unremarkable for the most part and you know few things a few exceptions so first of all on your heent exam your eye exam your extraocular motions are intact without pain you have a funduscopic exam that shows no papilledema that's good that just means there's no swelling in the back of your eye and on your neck exam you do have some posterior mild posterior paraspinal muscular tenderness in the cervical spine and in bilateral trapezius musculature as well and some tightness in those muscles as well and otherwise on your exam let's see your heart exam on your heart exam you have that grade three out of six systolic ejection murmur that's unchanged from your prior exam so it just means i hear some sounds in your heart as it's beating and i'm not too worried about that we'll watch that and otherwise normal heart exam and and your physical examination otherwise is normal and unremarkable and so now let's talk about my assessment and your plan so carolyn for your first problem of the headache i do think that you have a tension type headache and i think this because you've got some tension and tightness in your paraspinal muscles meaning the muscles around your neck and your shoulders and you know working at the computer i think is contributing to this and also probably the stress so you can continue to take that tylenol for the pain i'm also gon na give you a mild muscle relaxant i'll write you for flexeril five milligrams three times a day and you can take that that will help relax those muscles in your neck and that should help with the symptoms i want you to come back or give us a call if the headaches become more severe or suddenly worsen or you develop a fever but i do n't think that this is a a sign of a stroke or any bleeding in your brain or anything like that i think it's more related to tightness in your muscles in your neck now for your second problem of your diabetes mellitus let's continue you on the metformin five hundred milligrams i am going to order a hemoglobin a1c and also a cbc and a chem-12 to check some of your blood tests blood chemistries and so forth and we will continue you on the metformin i do want you to check your blood sugars daily and that will be very helpful so when you come back in a month i want you to bring those numbers with you we can talk about it again and please do try to get back into your exercise routine that's really gon na help you keep those blood sugars under control as well okay so how does that sound for a plan any other questions for me

[patient] i i i think the sugar has been okay
[doctor] okay we checked your hemoglobin a1c last time i'm looking at your records in epic and it showed that it was you know seven . one so it's it's it's good but it could be better any you know we talked about it controlling your diet or improving your diet and trying to have a balanced meal and not eating some of these sweets and high sugar items how is that going i know you had talked about your wife being a great cook and making cookies and that's hard to stay away from obviously how are things going with that

Chief Complaint: hypothyroidism 
Secondary Complaints: weight loss; acne

MEDICAL NOTE:

CHIEF COMPLAINT

Hypothyroidism.
Abnormal liver enzymes.
Abnormal weight gain.
Acne vulgaris.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Christine Hernandez is a 39-year-old female who presents today for evaluation and management of abnormal liver enzymes and hypothyroidism.

When the patient was last seen, her thyroid medicine was changed to Unithroid, but due to the cost of $75, she has not yet started the new medicine and continues taking her previous thyroid medicine. She denies utilizing the coupon that was previously recommended for the Unithroid. Similarly, the patient was prescribed Epiduo for her acne vulgaris, which she did not fill due to the cost of $100. She tried filling both prescriptions at Walmart.

Mrs. Hernandez still presents with abnormal weight gain. She questioned if her oral contraceptive Microgestin, which was discontinued, could have been the cause. Additional symptoms included acne, hirsutism. She is attempting to modify her intake and plans to resume her gym membership in July as she will be on vacation. She inquired about the impact on weight loss of chromium, CLA, and amino acids.

The patient confirmed that she is taking her high dose Vitamin D as prescribed. She does suffer from constipation and she treats with MiraLAX.

She denies previous treatment for her acne vulgaris. She denies ever using clindamycin topical antibiotic. She reports having sensitive skin, developing rashes with various skin products.

PAST HISTORY

Medical
Hypothyroidism.
Acne Vulgaris.
Vitamin D deficiency.
Abnormal weight gain.
Hirsutism.
Constipation.

CURRENT MEDICATIONS

Benzoyl Peroxide.
Clindamycin Gel applied topically.
Vitamin D 2000 IU daily.
Unithroid.
MiraLAX.

ALLERGIES

No known allergies.

RESULTS

Dexamethasone Suppression Test: Normal.

Salivary Cortisol Tests: 2 out of 3 were normal. Not consistent with Cushing’s Syndrome.

Hepatic Function Panel: ALT 128.
Lipid Panel: Total cholesterol 222 mg/dL, HDL 44 mg/dL, LDL 153 mg/dL, non-HDL 178 mg/dL.

FAI: Normal.

ASSESSMENT

• Hypothyroidism.
• Abnormal liver enzymes.
• Abnormal weight gain.
• Acne vulgaris
• Vitamin D deficiency.
• Hirsutism

PLAN

Hypothyroidism
The patient will again attempt to initiate Unithroid. I have printed out the prescription and a discount card, which should result in a reduced price. She will contact my office if she encounters additional issues.

Abnormal liver enzymes
We have seen improvement since the discontinuation of Microgestin. I recommended the spermicide Phexxi for alternative birth control. The patient will also continue working on weight loss, which should additionally improve her liver enzymes.

Abnormal weight gain
Cushing’s Syndrome has been ruled out. I reviewed the weight loss study with the patient, she will call within a month if she is interested in participating. I advised her to follow a low carbohydrate, low cholesterol, abstain from alcohol, and reduce fatty foods diet.

Acne vulgaris
Epiduo was not covered and too expensive. The patient will try benzoyl peroxide and Clindamycin separately to see if the price improves.

Vitamin D deficiency
The patient will complete the high dose vitamin D and then should start vitamin D 2000 IU per day to maintain her levels.

Hirsutism
Her androgen levels were normal.

INSTRUCTIONS

She will repeat all labs prior to her next visit.","[doctor] next patient is christine hernandez , uh , date of birth is january 13th , 1982 .

[doctor] i'm pretty good . so it looks like you've completed the covid vaccine , that's great .
[patient] yes , i did .
[doctor] anything new since your last visit ?
[patient] no , i did all the tests that you had recommended me to take . i have n't been able to take the thyroid medicine , the one that you prescribed , as i'm still taking my old one . um , the price was a little high on the new one .
[doctor] okay , so did ... did you try the coupon that i gave you ?
[patient] i did not try the coupon , uh , there was a charge of $ 75 .
[doctor] okay , well , next time that ... that coupon should help , and it should only be about $ 3 .
[patient] okay , um ... i do n't have it , do you happen to have another one you can give me ?
[doctor] yep , right here .
[patient] wonderful , thank you so much , and ... and then the gel , they are charging me $ 100 for it . so , i do n't know if this is because it's a ... it's wal-mart , or if i should try somewhere else , or ... maybe you know how or where i can get it cheaper .
[doctor] yeah , let's try something else , um ... sometimes it can be cheaper if we just prescribe you the individual ingredients of a medication , rather than the , the combined medication itself .
[patient] that would be great .
[doctor] so , that's clindamycin gel and benzoyl peroxide , uh , maybe by doing them separately , they could be a lot cheaper . so , that we can do . the unithroid , with the discount code , should only be about $ 9 for 90 days .
[patient] okay , that would be great . yeah , they were charging me $ 75 , and i just could n't pay that .
[doctor] maybe we'll try different pharmacy , as well .
[patient] okay . so , do you think that my weight gain could have been the birth control that i was taking before that caused it ?
[doctor] maybe . i do n't really see an endocrine cause for it , at least , so i would need to see the , the hyperandrogynism or high testosterone . or , a high dhea , to cause acne , or hair growth , or any of that stuff . but , the numbers are n't showing up out of range .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] i really do n't see any endocrine cause for it , like i said . your growth hormone was fine , but we definitely want to and need to treat it . um , i do n't know if we talked about maybe a little weight loss study .
[patient] you mentioned the weight loss study , and you mentioned that i have some meal plans , um , that you had given me . i still have those , too .
[doctor] have you tried to make any changes in the diet since the last time we spoke ?
[patient] i've been trying to get better . i will start back at the gym in july , because of my contract , i had to put a hold on it until then .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] so , i do want to start doing that . i will be a little freer since , um , i'll be on vacation after july 8th .
[doctor] okay , good .
[patient] and then my cousin was telling me to ask you about cla , because it's supposed to help your metabolism . is that okay to take ?
[doctor] um , i'm not sure . what is c , cla ?
[patient] i'm not sure what it is , either .
[doctor] okay , well , i'm unfamiliar with it , so ...
[patient] okay . i also have a coworker who has a thyroid issue too , and she suggested to try chromium for weight loss .
[doctor] so , that likely will not help too much . you can try either , if you really want to , but then ... it will not accept you into the weight loss study if you try those two .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] chromium is just a supplement and it wo n't help that much .
[patient] it wo n't , okay , thank you .
[doctor] it wo n't hurt ... okay , i should n't say that it wo n't hurt , but , it also wo n't help that much . so , it's up to you .
[patient] okay . and so , my cousin also suggested amino acids , and that i might find them in certain foods , i guess , for my workout .
[doctor] yeah . amino acids are fine , they wo n't , wo n't really help with weight loss either , but it might help , uh , you replenish , and just kind of , feel hydrated .
[patient] okay . are they proteins ? um , my cousin said she had lost some weight , and has been working out every day , but she does n't work , so ... i do n't know .
[doctor] yes , amino acids are what make up the protein , which is in any food you eat , with any protein . so , meats , dairy , nuts , any of that sort of thing .
[patient] okay , thank you . got it .
[doctor] all right . um , are you allergic to any medications ?
[patient] no , not that i know of .
[doctor] okay . is your s- skin pretty sensitive ?
[patient] yes .
[doctor] all right .
[patient] um , yeah , my size , i will start getting rashes , with different products .
[doctor] and have you ever tried clindamycin topical , as an antibiotic for your acne ?
[patient] no , i've never tried anything for it .
[doctor] okay . we might give you some of that .
[patient] okay . and i also want to mention that my feet do swell up a lot .
[doctor] okay . i'm ... let me take a look at that for just a moment . um , any constipation ?
[patient] yes , i also do have that problem .
[doctor] all right . mira- miralax will definitely help with that .
[patient] okay , yes , my doctor did also recommend that .
[doctor] great . all right , let's do an exam real quick . please have a seat on this table and i'll listen to your lungs and heart .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] all right , deep breath . all right , again .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] all right , sounds good .
[patient] great .
[doctor] let me take a look at your feet and ankles .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] all right , they look okay right now , certainly let your doctor know about this if it gets any worse or reoccurs .
[patient] okay , i will do that .
[doctor] now , let's go over your lab work . so , when you took that pill , the dexamethasone test , you passed , which means you do n't have cushing's syndrome . on that test , at least . the salivary cortisol , though , unless you did one wrong ... two of them were completely normal and one was abnormal , so , we might need to repeat that in the future .
[patient] okay , that's okay .
[doctor] all right , so , your cholesterol was quite high . the total cholesterol was 222 . the good cholesterol was about 44 . the bad was 153 , and it should be less than 100 . the non-hdl was about 178 , and it should be less than 130 . the good cholesterol should be over 50 , and it was 44 . so , your screen for diabetes is ... was fine . you do have a vitamin d deficiency , and , i do n't know if we started the vitamin d yet , or not .
[patient] yes , we did . i- i do need to take one today , though .
[doctor] okay . so , i also checked a lot of other pituitary hormones , iron levels ... everything else seemed to be pretty good , and in decent range .
[patient] okay , that sounds great . so , i wanted to also show you my liver enzymes , um , because i have n't come back since then ... but i was also happy , because one of them was back to normal .
[doctor] okay , great . let's see them .
[patient] okay . so , the one that's 30 , that was almost 200 not so long ago .
[doctor] yeah , your alt was about 128 .
[patient] okay , and , and back in october was 254 .
[doctor] yeah , this is much better .
[patient] okay , great . and then it dropped in january , and then it dropped a little more in march , since i stopped taking the medicine in december .
[doctor] okay , that's good . so ... i'm proud of you with the course of your labs , so before i forget , i'm going to , uh , just put your labs into the computer today , and i wo n't be checking your vitamin d level for some time .
[patient] okay . so , with the thyroid , and the low vitamin d , does that always happen together ?
[doctor] um , i do have a lot of people that have thyroid , thyroid issues and they have vitamin d deficiency .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] this is what i'm , um , i'm going to do . i'm going to put , print out your prescriptions , so you can shop around at the pharmacies and see if you can find better prices .
[patient] okay , that way i can go ask them and try cvs .
[doctor] yeah , that sounds like a plan .
[patient] okay , good . so , the weight loss study that you mentioned , when does that start ? or , how does that work ?
[doctor] so , we are about to start , as we just got approval last week , and we are just waiting on our paperwork so we can get started .
[patient] okay , and what's involved with that ?
[doctor] so , it'll involve you receiving a medication which has been used for diabetes treatment , and it works mostly in the gut on satiety , or satiety hormones . um , the most common side effects are going to be nausea , vomiting , diarrhea and constipation . they are s- uh , six arms , to the study . one is a placebo , the other ones are a , various as ... various dosages of the medication , excuse me . um , you would receive an injection once a week . also , keep in mind that most of the weight loss medications are not covered by insurance .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] so , it's a way of getting them , but , the odds of getting one of the arms with the medication that are in your favor , right , might be only one out of five of our hundred patients that we have on the list for the study that will receive the placebo .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] does that make sense ?
[patient] yes , it does .
[doctor] so , we do expect pretty big weight loss , because of what we learn in diabetes study . so , it's a year long , uh , process , and it's an injection once a week . you come in weekly for the first four , five weeks , i believe . and then , after that , it's once a month . you do get a stipend for partici- for participating in the study , and parking is validated , and whatever else that you need for the study .
[patient] okay , do you know how much the stipend is ?
[doctor] um , i will have to double check for you , and , you do n't have to be my patient , you just have to meet the criteria . so the criteria is a bmi greater than 30 , if you do n't have any other medical condition . or , a bmi greater than 27 , if you do have another medical condition , like your cholesterol . um , a bmi greater than 27 would quali- uh , qualify you .
[patient] i have a friend who might be interested , and she does have diabetes .
[doctor] if she has d- diabetes , then she wo n't qualify .
[patient] okay , you ca n't if you ... if you have diabetes , got it .
[doctor] correct . yeah , the only thing that , um , they can not have , really , is diabetes . so , either a psychiatric disease , or schizophrenia , bipolar , things like that .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] but , if they have hypertension , high cholesterol , things like that ... they can definitely sign up .
[patient] and they can , okay . thank you for explaining that .
[doctor] of course . so , do you want me to try to get you into that study ? or , would you just like to try , me to prescribe something ? it's kind of up to you .
[patient] i think i'll just wait for a little bit now .
[doctor] all right , sounds good . i'll give you the information for the research , it's just in my office . um , it is a different phone number , though . so then , if you're interested , just call us within a month , because i do n't know how long , uh , the , the wait will be .
[patient] okay , will do .
[doctor] perfect . so , let me go grab your discount card for the unithroid . um , when you go in to activate it , the instructions are on this card , and then you use your insurance ... then , show them this , and ask how much it'll cost . if it's too expensive , just let me know .
[patient] i will . thank you so much for your help on that .
[doctor] you're welcome . then , what i did is , i gave you a topical antibiotic , plus i gave you the benzoyl peroxide . so , the peroxide may bleach your sheets , but , you want to make sure to take it and apply it at night , so you do n't have a reaction from the sun during the day .
[patient] okay , i can do that .
[doctor] but , you do also want to make sure that you do n't mess up your sheets .
[patient] okay , sounds good .
[doctor] um , so , that's that . and then , let's see how you do on the other medications . i think this will , this will get better . in the meantime , a low-carb diet , avoid alcohol and fatty foods , and low chole- cholesterol foods .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] and again , once you finish your dose of vitamin d , for the vitamin d deficiency , you're gon na start with the 2000iu daily , so that you're able to maintain those levels . sound good ?
[patient] yes , that sounds great .
[doctor] i really think your liver enzymes are going to get better once you lose the weight , though .
[patient] okay , that would be great .
[doctor] since we stopped your birth control , we can try once called phexxi , which is kind of like a spermicide , basically .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] and you just apply it before intercourse .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] if you need some , uh , just let me know .
[patient] okay , i will . i'll let you know .
[doctor] okay , perfect . so , stay put for me now . i'm going to go see if they have discount samples , and bring you that prescription . and then , i'm going to order the labs for next time .
[patient] okay , great , thank you so much .
[doctor] you're welcome .
[doctor] so , under the plan , under abnormal liver enzymes , they have improved since discontinuation of her birth control . under abnormal weight gain , her dexamethasone suppression test was normal . two out of three salivary cortisol tests were normal , not consistent with cushing's , and therefore we're ruling out cushing's . under her hirsutism , her androgen levels were normal . for the acne vulgaris , the epiduo was not covered , so we'll try benzoyl peroxide with clindamycin , and remove the previous information . on the hyperthyroidism , we'll print out her prescriptions . unithroid should be better priced with the discount card , and we'll repeat levels of everything before next visit . thanks .",3536.217391304348,"Benzoyl Peroxide.

Secondary Complaints: gynecomastia

MEDICAL NOTE:

CHIEF COMPLAINT

Hypogonadism.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Mr. Paul Edwards is a 59-year-old male, an established patient, who presents to the clinic today for hypogonadism. He was last seen on 11/24/2020. The patient’s history includes positive for HIV, and today he is concerned with gynecomastia.

The patient is doing well, overall, and feels the testosterone is helping. He reports weight stability, feels lively, good, more vigorous, and he is sleeping well. He also thinks the testosterone is having a positive effect on his blood work. He endorses that his triglycerides have always been elevated and adds that they were as high as 265 mg/dL. The patient presented a copy of his bloodwork, showing a significant decrease in his cholesterol after 5 months. Mr. Edwards questioned if the changes in his blood work were due to the testosterone. He also noted that his red blood cell count has not increased. The patient inquired about possible benefits of Indole-3-carbinol, which is a broccoli extract for estrogen control.

Currently, the patient is dosing 140 ng/dL of testosterone per week and inquired if his dose could be increased to 175 ng/dL. He recalled that he had recently injected testosterone before his last testosterone blood work was performed; last testosterone levels were greater than 1500 ng/dL. The patient confirms continued daily use of Finasteride and Cialis, prescribed by me, and stated he needs a refill for both.

Mr. Edwards mentioned he is taking correct steps to get his life ""together."" He also uses a med calendar to help with medication compliance.

PAST HISTORY

Medical
HIV

SOCIAL HISTORY

Utilizes med calendar to support medication compliance.
Actively trying to get his life together.

CURRENT MEDICATIONS

Cialis 5 mg tablet by mouth on days he exercises, 2.5 mg tablet by mouth on days without exercise.
Finasteride 5 mg half tablet daily.
Testosterone cypionate 140 mg.

RESULTS

PSA 0.6 ng/mL.
Triglycerides 145 mg/dL.
Total testosterone 1500 ng/dL, 11/24/2021.

ASSESSMENT

• Hypogonadism.

PLAN

I recommend maintaining current management. The patient’s last testosterone levels were greater than 1500 ng/dL, although this level was likely related to his recent injection. He requested an increase to his testosterone cypionate from 140 mg to 175 mg, which I denied due to his already high testosterone levels. I counseled the patient on the risks associated with high testosterone levels and Indole-3-carbinol and it’s lacking evidence to support his estrogen levels. The last time his estradiol levels were checked, they were normal; recommend annual screening.

I provided paper prescription refills for Cialis and Finasteride.","[doctor] next patient is paul edwards , date of birth is january 15th 1962 . so he's a 59 year old hiv positive gentleman here for hypogonadism . patient was last seen on november 24th 2020 . his notable things are number one , he is on 1 milliliter every 10 days , uh , his levels were less than 300 to begin with . he's on finasteride currently . he also takes cialis daily so he takes all his pills just from me . um , patient's other area of concern is gynecomastia which is ... which we will discuss with him today . his last psa was 0.66 and his last testosterone was greater than 1,500 .
[doctor] hey , how are you today ?
[patient] all right , how have you been ?
[doctor] i'm good .
[patient] good , good .
[doctor] have you lost some weight or are you at least putting on some muscle ? you look trim .
[patient] no , i think i'm pretty much the same as i've always been .
[doctor] really ? okay , maybe it's just your black shirt . makes you look thin .
[patient] yeah , i guess that's it .
[doctor] so health wise , how is everything going ?
[patient] good , the testosterone's going well .
[doctor] that's great .
[patient] uh , it helped me out . i feel good , more vigorous , sleeping well and i think it's having some positive effects . not so much physically because like i said i've- i've been this way my whole life , but i'm seeing some good improvements in my bloodwork .
[doctor] okay , well that's good .
[patient] so the finasteride i'm only taking half a pill , it's the 5 milligram one .
[doctor] yeah , i remember you telling me that .
[patient] and cialis , on the days i work out i take 5 milligrams otherwise i take two and a half milligram pills , but , uh , i have been out of it .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] but overall i'm doing well , i'm actually taking the correct steps to get my life together .
[doctor] good . it's always great to hear . well let's take a look . uhm , i'm gon na listen to your heart and lungs .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] please use my general exam template , all right . just take a few breaths .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] in and out .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] all right , everything sounds good , no concerns there .
[patient] great . so i wanted to show you something .
[doctor] sure .
[patient] look at this .
[doctor] okay , this is your cholesterol ?
[patient] yeah , my cholesterol and triglycerides . uh , i used to have high triglycerides , you see they were 265 milligrams per deciliter , and i took my first dose of the testosterone on the 28th .
[doctor] right .
[patient] now 5 months later look at my numbers .
[doctor] wow , that's remarkable .
[patient] is it the test ? it's the only change .
[doctor] i do n't know , i have n't honestly seen many guys over the years that have cholesterol problems and this . i mean there's a big correlation between diabetic control and testosterone replacement , meaning those who get good levels of their test see their diabetic control improve .
[patient] yeah .
[doctor] but i have n't seen a lot of data on the impact on cholesterol . regardless , we will take it .
[patient] i agree . i was very impressed with my triglycerides and was just wondering if the test may be what's helping .
[doctor] yeah , that's an unbelievable difference .
[patient] 145 milligrams per deciliter from 265 milligrams per deciliter is awesome . i also read that it- it's cardioprotective .
[doctor] absolutely .
[patient] my red blood cell count has increased .
[doctor] yeah , i saw that . it's fine though .
[patient] stable .
[doctor] your psa today is also , uh , is good also . it's , uh , .6 i think .
[patient] yeah . , is it ?
[doctor] yeah , it was .5 last year and anything under 4 is good .
[patient] nice , that's good news .
[doctor] so it just needs to be checked every year or so .
[patient] so in terms of , uh , estrogen control i've been hearing that indole-3-carbinol , or broccoli extract , supposedly can improve my estrogen levels . have you ever heard of it ?
[doctor] yeah , i've heard of it but i have n't had anybody consistently use it . i mean , your levels are fine and we checked your estra- estradiol and it was not elevated , so .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] i would argue that we could test that in the fall if you want , but we do n't need to do , uh , do any more tests ... any more than test once a year , excuse me .
[patient] okay , what about increasing my testosterone to 175 milligrams ? i'm at 140 now .
[doctor] well , your levels are high .
[patient] are they right now ?
[doctor] well , i mean they were last time .
[patient] yeah but i just- just injected though , or i had right before that was taken .
[doctor] i know . i know you had then , uh , when did you inject this time ?
[patient] i figure i'm on my eighth day today .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] so i'm due to dose on thursday or friday .
[doctor] all right .
[patient] i have a little med calendar and i put checks and ts on it . that helps me .
[doctor] that's a great idea . so look , the biggest issue i've seen , even if your levels today are around 700 , is that your peaks are getting greater than 1,500 , putting you at a higher chance of needing to come off due to blood thickness . and your risk will only astronomically go up the higher the dose that we go on .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] you look well , your levels are good and you're feeling well .
[patient] yeah , i'm feeling good .
[doctor] i'm going to be blunt . unfortunately this happens often where you're feeling good but you want to feel really good . i mean , i get it and this is why people get into problems with this stuff , right ? it's like , back in the day when it was n't prescribed by doctors and people would get it at gyms and stuff and they would take huge doses . and then they would have a heart attack at 50 .
[patient] yeah , they have to be taking a lot .
[doctor] likely they are taking more than testosterone , but still .
[patient] and they are taking stuff for a long time .
[doctor] true . but right now i would not change your dose .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] make sense ?
[patient] it does , i appreciate the discussion .
[doctor] no problem . what pharmacy are you using ? have you changed it or anything ?
[patient] no changes , i use walmart pharmacy . i do need more cialis and finasteride .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] i would prefer the paper prescription .
[doctor] for all of them ?
[patient] sure .
[doctor] all right , will do . i'm gon na get your prescriptions .

MEDICAL NOTE:

CHIEF COMPLAINT

Follow-up.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Nicole Miller is a 71-year-old female who presents for follow-up. The patient was called in for a follow up with me for chronic congestive heart failure with diastolic dysfunction. Her BNP had been 3000 in 03/2021, up to 6000 in 04/2021. She was increasingly dyspneic. We had changed her furosemide to torsemide at 20 mg by mouth daily. The patient is not on a potassium supplement currently. Her lisinopril had also been increased up to 10 mg daily in 03/2021.

I last saw her in 04/2021, and she had reported being interested in having her right knee replaced this summer at East Metropolitan Hospital, so it was recommended that we work to control her cardiovascular status prior to surgery. She is currently scheduled to have surgery on 06/24/2021. She plans to discontinue clopidogrel a week before her surgery.

The patient states that she has lost approximately 3 to 3.5 pounds since her last visit in 04/2021. Some of which may be water weight decreasing. She did report experiencing bilateral leg cramps which she treated with consumption of pickle juice, which did resolve the cramps. She thought the cramps were related to her being cold.

She is still taking iron supplementation. She denies any concerns with defecation.

Regarding her prior symptoms of heartburn, she denies any recent gastrointestinal issues. She notes that her heartburn was severe at one point but resolved after trying Prilosec for 2 weeks in 01/2021. She denies any issues with heartburn since that time and has stopped taking Prilosec altogether. She has since transitioned back to her original ""stomach medication"".

The patient is due for a colonoscopy. She is currently double covered with Medicare and private insurance.

PAST HISTORY

Medical
Chronic Congestive Heart Failure.
Iron deficiency Anemia.

Medications
Prilosec.

FAMILY HISTORY

No family history of colon cancer.

CURRENT MEDICATIONS

Torsemide 20 mg by mouth daily.
Lisinopril 10 mg daily.

RESULTS

Magnesium 1.7, hemoglobin WNL, potassium 3.9, creatinine 0.7, BUN 23.
03/2020 Hgb A1c 5.5.

ASSESSMENT

• Chronic congestive heart failure with mixed presentation.
• Preop examination.
• Diabetes mellitus.
• Colonoscopy

PLAN

Chronic congestive heart failure with mixed presentation.
She had an exacerbation of CHF earlier in the spring. We switched her from furosemide to torsemide and symptomatically, she is doing a lot better. She is about 1.5 kg down in weight. Her breathing is nonlabored. We are going to repeat an EKG today. Otherwise, continue her current regimen. Labs were checked and creatinine is appropriate. Her magnesium is below the preferred 2 at 1.7, with some occurrence of bilateral leg cramping, therefore we will start her on magnesium supplement.

Preop examination.
She is going to be having a right knee replacement at the end of 06/2021. We will schedule a preop check the first week or two of June prior to the surgery. She will discontinue clopidogrel for one week prior to knee replacement surgery; we will provide a reminder to patient of this as well.

Diabetes mellitus.
A1c is 5.5 on last check, so there is no need for a further A1c today. She may need another one prior to her surgery next month.

Colonoscopy.
The patient is overdue for a colonoscopy, which we will try to have done at County Hospital in the next month, prior to a change in her insurance. This is just a screening colonoscopy that she is overdue for. No family history of colon cancer.

The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.

INSTRUCTIONS

Complete EKG today. Schedule a preop checkup 1st or 2nd week of June. Start magnesium supplement. Call the clinic with any questions or new symptoms.","[doctor] next patient is nicole miller . date of birth is 09/18/1949 . patient was called for a follow-up with me for chronic congestive heart failure with diastolic dysfunction . bmp's been , uh , 3,000 in march , and is about six- was up to 6,000 in april . she was increasingly dyspneic . we changed her furosemide and torsemide 20 milligrams by mouth daily . uh to note , the patient is not currently on potassium supplement . her lisinopril had- has also been increased up to 10 milligrams daily in march . also did when i saw her last april . she reported being interested in having her right knee replaced this summer at east metro . it was recommended that we work to control her cardiovascular status before surgery .
[doctor] hey , miss miller , how are you today ?
[patient] i'm doing okay , thank you .
[doctor] i asked you to come in today because we want to keep- we want you to have this knee surgery this summer but we want to keep a close eye on you to make sure a week before your surgery you do n't suddenly go into congestive heart failure and it gets postponed .
[patient] yeah , that would not be good .
[doctor] i see you're scheduled on the 24th for surgery .
[patient] yeah , that's right .
[doctor] okay , good . well it looks like you have lost about 3 , 3 and a half pounds since i saw you last in april . some of that might be water weight , but still , this is positive .
[patient] yeah , i noticed that too . i think the oxyglutinine is helping as well . my urgency to use the bathroom is much better .
[doctor] well that's great .
[patient] yeah , i , i'm pleased about it too .
[doctor] you ever get leg or finger cramps or anything like that ?
[patient] yeah , i had leg cramps the other day , but i thought it might , was maybe just because i was cold as i had my ceiling fan on and fell asleep . i had cramps when i woke up in both legs right here . um i drank pickle juice and it went right away .
[doctor] well do n't , do n't get crazy with the pickle juice because all of the salt in it .
[patient] haha , i know , i only drink about 4 ounces or so .
[doctor] okay good .
[patient] um it went away so i did n't drink anymore . i find it works a lot better than trying to put some cream on my leg .
[doctor] sure just , just keep it in moderation .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] and then are you still on an iron supplement ? and are you using the bathroom okay ?
[patient] uh yes , everything is good .
[doctor] good . how is your heart burn doing ? any problems with that ?
[patient] no , it did get bad for a while so i tried to take some prilosec and then stopped that other one .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] um i did that for like , gosh , i think it was two weeks back in january and have n't had any problems since .
[doctor] great .
[patient] um and after i stopped taking that um i went back to the stomach one , so i'm doing good now .
[doctor] okay and you're still due for a colonoscopy , correct ?
[patient] uh yeah , that's right .
[doctor] all right , let's review your blood work real quick . i checked your hemoglobin level because you have had some anemia in the past but that is still doing great .
[patient] good , that's a relief to hear .
[doctor] your potassium is 3.9 so it's holding steady on the torsemide . your creatinine was .7 not .8 so you're doing well with kidney numbers . your bun may be a tiny bit elevated at 23 which is the number we look for for dehydration sometimes the kidneys , but it's not terrible . um so when i look at your numbers as a whole i think you're tolerating the torsemide okay at the current dose . i also sent out to look at the heart failure number- i sent to look at your heart failure number . there is a test called a bmp that i was monitoring and in march it was up to 3,000 and then went up to 6,000 in april before i made the change . i'm still waiting for those results .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] all in all i think you're doing good on paper though .
[patient] what about , um what's it called , a1c ? does that show up ?
[doctor] um i do n't think i ordered it but i could . your last a1c was 5.5 in march .
[patient] all righty .
[doctor] so your blood sugar is a little bit high , it was 169 today but that kind of depends on what you ate and you were n't fasting for the blood check so i might have to repeat that test for pre-op , but i do n't think we need to do it today .
[patient] all righty that sounds good .
[doctor] i checked your magnesium level because sometimes you uh urinate out magnesium with the water pills but it was normal at 1.7 and your blood pressure is also looking good .
[patient] okay great . that all sounds awesome .
[doctor] all right let's take a quick listen .
[doctor] use my general physical exam template .
[doctor] and take a couple of deep breaths for me .
[doctor] your lungs sound pretty good to me so keep doing what you're doing . um uh , like i said , i think you're doing good overall but let's just talk about a few things .
[patient] all righty .
[doctor] so we often like to keep people with heart problems on magnesium and get their levels up to around the 2-ish range . yours is a little bit less than 2 and we want that 2-ish range because it can help stabilize the heart muscle . so i might recommend putting you on magnesium supplement . it's supposed to be twice a day so that's kind of annoying , but i know you're on other medicines twice a day too , so i think you'll do fine .
[patient] yeah , that'll be okay .
[doctor] great . now before surgery we'll have to get you off your clopidogrel for a week beforehand .
[patient] yes , okay , i have everything written down on my phone , and i have a letter taped to the side of my bed to remind me .
[doctor] perfect ! we will give you a reminder as well . we will also need to complete a pre-op check within two weeks of your surgery during the first or second week of june .
[patient] okay , i'll put that down .
[doctor] you might also have to repeat an ekg before surgery which we could do today . i know i'm sure it feels like you're doing , you're always doing ekgs . um we do n't need to any x-rays of your chest because you had one recently , and we do n't need any more blood work because we did that today .
[patient] yeah , i do a lot of ekgs . i'm basically a regular . but i'm happy to do one today , no problem .
[doctor] lastly , once we get your knee surgery , um we , we should think about getting you a colonoscopy . we can do it here locally because you have medicare . do you have private insurance also ?
[patient] yeah , i have both .
[doctor] okay so yes , you can get it , your colonoscopy , wherever you'd like .
[patient] okay , well my husband's insurance may be running out . might we be able to get the procedure done sooner ? maybe in the next 30 days ? is that okay ?
[doctor] um i can put it in right now for , uh , for county for the next 30 days , and they might be able to get you in within the next few weeks . it should not take , it should not make you ineligible for the surgery . in other words completing a colonoscopy would not delay your surgery .
[patient] okay , good .
[doctor] so let me see . i've been doing one of two things at every one , and everyone is great so it depends more on timing availability of their or for the colonoscopy . we can send you to dr. martin for the surgery who is at county surgical services down here or the other option is valley medical , and they do it at springfield .
[patient] okay , that sounds good .
[doctor] i think either direction they're good technicians of the colon .
[patient] okay , yeah whatever you can get me in , that works great .
[doctor] so i'll call around . now if you get that done and they tell you 10 years then you'll be good to go .
[patient] great , thank you .
[doctor] you're welcome . have a great day . let us know if you need anything else , okay ?
[patient] sounds good .
[doctor] all right , assessment and plan .
[doctor] chronic chf . mixed presentation . had a exacerbation of cf , chf earlier in the spring . we switched her from a furosemide to torsemide and symptomatically she is doing a lot better . she's about 3 , 3 and a half pounds down in weight . breathing is non-labored . going to repeat ekg today but otherwise continue with her current regimen . labs checked and creatinine is appropriate .
[doctor] uh number 2 , pre-op examination . she is , she's having a right knee replacement end of june . also , she would like to have a colonoscopy performed which we'll try to have done at uh bartley regional , rightley regional hospital in the next month , uh , prior to a change in her insurance . this is just a screening colonoscopy that she is overdue for . no family history of colon cancer .
[doctor] uh the next one is diabetes . a1c is 5.1 on the last check so no need for further a1c today . she may need another one prior to her surgery next month though . thanks .",344.6,"Torsemide 20 mg by mouth daily.

CHIEF COMPLAINT

Left ankle pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Matthew Murphy is a pleasant 20-year-old male who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of left ankle pain. The onset of his pain began 2 days ago, when he stepped off of a curb and landed on his left ankle wrong. He denies hearing a pop at the time of the injury, however, he describes his ankle as feeling extended and stretched. He was able to ambulate back to his house after the incident but with pain. He denies any previous injuries to his left ankle. His pain is localized to the lateral aspect of his left ankle and can be rated at 8 out of 10 without medication. When taking ibuprofen his pain level is 7 out of 10. He states he has also iced and elevated his ankle.

SOCIAL HISTORY

Patient reports that he has been working from home since the start of COVID-19 and enjoys taking lots of walks.

MEDICATIONS

Patient reports taking ibuprofen.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Musculoskeletal: Patient reports left ankle pain.

VITALS

Vitals are slightly elevated due to pain level but are otherwise stable.

PHYSICAL EXAM

NEURO: Normal strength and sensation bilaterally.
MSK: Examination of the left ankle: Ecchymosis noted over the lateral malleolus. Edema is present. Tenderness to palpation laterally. No joint laxity appreciated. No bony tenderness to palpation of the foot. Capillary refill is brisk at less than 3 seconds bilaterally. Strong dorsalis pedis pulses bilaterally.

RESULTS

These reveal no fracture or bony abnormalities.

ASSESSMENT

Left ankle sprain of the lateral ligament complex.

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I have had a lengthy discussion with the patient in regards to his current symptoms. We discussed that his symptoms are consistent with an ankle sprain of the lateral ligament complex. The nature of the diagnosis and treatment options were discussed. At this time he will continue to follow the RICE protocol. He will continue to take NSAIDs as needed for pain and swelling. He will also be placed into an Aircast for ankle stabilization and will be provided crutches in order to remain non-weight-bearing. We discussed that it may be a few days before he feels able to tolerate walking. I also advised him that his symptoms will likely start to improve significantly over the next 4 to 6 days.

INSTRUCTIONS

The patient will follow up with me in 2 weeks to assess his progress, sooner if needed.

CHIEF COMPLAINT

Right ankle pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Carolyn Jones is a pleasant 38-year-old female who presents to the clinic today for evaluation of right ankle pain.

The patient sustained an injury to her right ankle when she slipped and fell on ice while taking her garbage out yesterday. This was her first right ankle injury. She believes she heard a pop at the time, but denies any associated numbness or tingling. Initially, she was unable to bear weight on the ankle and required help getting inside; however, she is now able to slightly bear weight but ambulates with an antalgic gait. Ice, elevation, and ibuprofen have been helpful at reducing her pain. She rates her current pain as 4/10, her pain without medication as 6/10, and her pain with medication as 1/10.

Of note, the patient participates in an intramural soccer league but has not been able to play since this injury.

MEDICAL HISTORY

The patient reports that she has had several ankle injuries in the past. This is her first right ankle injury.

SOCIAL HISTORY

The patient reports that she has a history of playing sports. She played soccer in college and is now in an intramural soccer league.

MEDICATIONS

The patient reports that she has been taking ibuprofen.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Musculoskeletal: Reports right ankle pain.
Neurological: Denies right ankle numbness or tingling.

VITALS

Normal

PHYSICAL EXAM

GAIT: antalgic gait
CV: Brisk capillary refill to less than 3 seconds. Strong dorsalis pedis pulse.
NEURO: Sensation in the right ankle is intact to light touch distally.
MSK: Examination of the right ankle: Ecchymosis over the lateral malleolus associated with trace edema in that area. Tenderness to palpation over the anterolateral soft tissue. No laxity on anterior drawer testing or inversion stress testing. No bony tenderness on palpation of the foot or ankle area. Findings are consistent bilaterally.

RESULTS

X-ray images of the right ankle were obtained and reviewed today. These reveal no evidence of fracture.

ASSESSMENT

Lateral ligament complex sprain, Right ankle.

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, her symptoms are consistent with a right ankle sprain of the lateral ligament complex, more specifically the anterior talofibular ligament. We had a lengthy discussion regarding the nature of this injury and the course of treatment. I advised her to keep her leg elevated when she is seated and continue to ice her ankle. She should also continue taking ibuprofen as-needed for pain and inflammation management. She will be placed in an Aircast to help stabilize her ankle, and I am going to order crutches so she can remain non-weight-bearing for the next couple of days. At that point, she can start bearing weight on the ankle as tolerated.

INSTRUCTIONS

The patient will follow up in 2 weeks.

After reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I have had a lengthy discussion with the patient in regard to her current symptoms. I have prescribed the patient meloxicam 15 mg once a day to treat the pain and swelling. She was advised to stop taking any anti-inflammatory such as Motrin or Advil. I have also recommended that the patient attend formal physical therapy to strengthen her right knee. I have also advised her to continue to use the ACE wrap and wear a right knee brace for a few days. She should continue light walking with her brace on. The patient was advised to stop basketball until she follows up in 7 days.

Regarding her diabetes, she should continue to monitor her blood sugars daily. She should reach out to her primary care physician if she sees an increase in her blood sugars due to loss of activity.

INSTRUCTIONS

The patient will follow up with me in 7 days to check on her progress. If her swelling has not improved, we will consider obtaining a CT or MRI of the right knee to evaluate for a possible medial collateral ligament strain.

---------------------------------------------","[doctor] hi virginia how're you today
[patient] i'm good thanks how are you
[doctor] good so you know you got that knee x-ray when you first came in but tell me a little bit about what happened
[patient] i was playing basketball and jerry ran into me and the inside of my knee hurts
[doctor] okay did you fall to the ground or did you just kinda plant and he pushed and you went one way and your knee did n't
[patient] i did fall to the ground
[doctor] you did fall to the ground okay and did you land on the kneecap i mean did it hurt a lot were you able to get up and continue on
[patient] i landed on my side i was not able to continue on
[doctor] okay so you get off the off the court is jerry a good player you just got ta ask that question
[patient] not really
[doctor] no
[patient] he does n't have much game
[doctor] okay okay well you know i love basketball i'm a little short for the game but i absolutely love to watch basketball so it's really cool that you're out there playing it so tell me about a little bit about where it hurts
[patient] on the inside
[doctor] on the inside of it okay and after the injury did they do anything special for you or you know did you get ice on it right away or try anything
[patient] i had ice and an ace wrap
[doctor] you had ice and what
[patient] an ace wrap
[doctor] and an ace wrap okay now how many days ago was this exactly
[patient] seven
[doctor] seven days ago okay yeah your right knee still looks a little swollen for seven days ago so i'm gon na go ahead and now i also see that you're diabetic and that you take five hundred milligrams of metformin twice a day are you still you're still on that medication is that correct
[patient] correct
[doctor] and do you check your blood sugars every morning at home
[patient] every morning
[doctor] okay great and since this i'm the reason i'm asking all these questions i'm a little concerned about the inactivity with your your knee pain and you know how diabetes you need to be very you know active and and taking your medicine to keep that under control so you know may wan na continue to follow up with your pcp for that diabetes as we go through here and just watch your blood sugars extra as we go through that now i'm gon na go ahead and examine your your right knee and when i push on the outside does that hurt at all
[patient] no
[doctor] okay and when i push on this inside where it's a little swollen does that hurt
[patient] yes
[doctor] yeah okay i'm just gon na ask a question did you hear or feel a pop in your knee when you were doing this
[patient] i did not no
[doctor] you did not okay okay what are you doing for the pain today
[patient] some exercises ice and mobic
[doctor] okay okay so i'm gon na continue all of my exam when i go ahead and pull on your knee the first thing i'm looking at is i do see some ecchymosis and swelling on the inside of that right knee and when i push around that knee i can see that there is fluid in the knee a little bit of fluid in the knee we call that effusion so i can appreciate some of that effusion and that could be either fluid or blood at this point from the injury that you had now you do have pain with palpation on the medial aspect of that right knee and that's that's concerning for me when i'm gon na just i just wan na move your knee a little bit it does n't look like when i extend it and flex it that you have a full range of motion does it hurt a lot when i moved it back a little more than normal
[patient] yes it hurts
[doctor] okay okay yeah so you do have some decreased range of motion in that right knee now i'm just gon na sit here and and lay you back and i'm gon na pull on your knee and twist your knee a little bit okay you currently there is a negative varus and valgus stress test that's really important so here's what i'm thinking for that right knee i think you have may have a medial collateral ligament strain from you know maybe the twisting motion be right before you fell to the ground i want you to continue to use an ace wrap i'm gon na give you a right knee brace we're gon na wear that for a few days and then i'm gon na send you to physical therapy so we can continue strengthening the muscles around the right knee now that x-ray as far as the x-ray results that x-ray that i did it this morning in the office the the bony alignment's in good position i do n't see any evidence of any fractures i do notice the the effusion around the right knee just a small amount of fluid but we're just gon na continue to watch that i'm gon na give you a prescription i'd like you to stop taking any of the nonsteroidals that you're taking the motrin or advil whichever one of those and i'm gon na give you meloxicam fifteen milligrams and i want you to take that daily for the pain and swelling i want you to just continue exercising with the the braces and everything on so if you can you can get out and do some light walking that'll be good and then again for your diabetes like i said just continue to watch those blood sugars daily and if you start to see any significant increase in them because of your loss of activity just reach out to your primary care physician now do you have any questions for me
[patient] when can i play basketball again
[doctor] yeah that's a great question i'm gon na ask well my first off i want to see you back here in in seven days you know in a week i want you to make an appointment we're gon na relook at it we're gon na determine if that swelling got any worse and if we need to go on to potentially ordering like a cat scan or an mri of that knee to look and see if there was any significant damage to the ligament so that's for for sure for seven days you're not gon na be playing basketball now are you in a ligue or is that just you get like pick up basketball
[patient] i just played the wife with fun
[doctor] okay okay good that's a great activity like i said i wish i could play now i i also know your your family do n't they own that sports store down right off a main street that sells a lot of sporting equipment

MEDICAL NOTE:

CHIEF COMPLAINT

Right foot ulcer.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Jeremy Roberts is a 79-year-old male who presents today for evaluation of a right foot ulcer. He reports an ulcer on his right foot has been present for approximately 6 to 8 weeks. He first noticed the ulcer after working outside. There is no associated pain, however, he feels the ulcer may have worsened from when he first noticed it. He denies experiencing any fevers or chills. He does however experience tension headaches quite frequently. He denies any pain in his calves when he walks. At this time the patient does not have a podiatrist for yearly foot exams.

He is a diabetic and takes insulin. His blood sugar has been running higher than normal and his last hemoglobin A1c was higher than 9. Occasionally he will also experience numbness and tingling in his feet, especially with colder weather.

In terms of his heart disease, the patient sustained a heart attack in 2018 and underwent stent placement at the right coronary artery. He is currently taking aspirin 81 mg daily. He denies chest pain or shortness of breath.

MEDICAL HISTORY

Patient reports history of diabetes and heart disease. He sustained a heart attack in 2018.

SURGICAL HISTORY

Patient reports undergoing stent placement at the right coronary artery.

SOCIAL HISTORY

Patient reports he is a former smoker. He previously smoked 2 packs a day for 20 years and was able to stop smoking approximately 4 years ago. Currently he is not very active but he does work around the house.

MEDICATIONS

Patient reports taking aspirin 81 mg daily and insulin.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Constitutional: Denies fevers and chills.
Cardiovascular: Denies chest pain.
Respiratory: Denies dyspnea.
Skin: Patient reports right foot ulcer.
Neurological: Patient reports headaches and numbness and tingling in feet.

VITALS

No fever.
Blood pressure: 127/80
Heart rate: 60s

PHYSICAL EXAM

CV: 2/6 systolic ejection murmur heard at the left base.
RESPIRATORY: Clear to auscultation bilaterally
NECK: No jugular venous distention or carotid bruits
MSK: Examination of the right lower extremity: No palpable dorsalis pedis or posterior tibial pulses. There is a 2 x 3 cm ulcerated lesion on the right lateral foot near the 5th metacarpal metatarsophalangeal joint. No associated cellulitis. No pain to palpation of the right foot. There is associated granulation tissue and some slight purulent discharge from the wound.

ASSESSMENT

1. Non-healing ulcer, right foot
2. Diabetes
3. Coronary artery disease

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination findings today, I have had a lengthy discussion with the patient in regards to his current symptoms. We discussed that his right foot ulcer is fairly sizable and will require wound care. I advised him that the ulcer does not appear to be healing and that further studies will be needed to assess if he has adequate blood supply to heal his foot wound. He was advised that due to his diabetes it is possible surgical intervention such as stent placement or bypass surgery may be required to improve his blood supply. I also advised him that I believe we will be able to heal his wound. At this time, I have recommended continued wound care and for him to also continue taking aspirin 81 mg daily. We will order an arterial ultrasound of the lower extremities. He will also be referred to podiatry for a consult.

Regarding his diabetes, this appears to be unstable as the patient reports his last hemoglobin a1c was greater than 9 and is now experiencing a non-healing right foot ulcer. We discussed the importance of blood sugar control as this will impact his wound healing. At this time, I have recommended that he follow-up with his primary care physician for further care.

The patient's coronary artery disease is currently stable. It is recommended that he continue to take his statin as prescribed. I will contact his cardiologist for medical clearance should surgical intervention be required for his non-healing right foot ulcer.

---------------------------------------------","[doctor] hi jeremy how are you
[patient] i'm really good thank you how are you
[doctor] i'm okay the the medical assistant told me that you had this ulcer on your foot that's been there for a couple of weeks
[patient] yes
[doctor] going away
[patient] yeah it's been there gosh it's like six or so weeks right now and it's and it's on my right foot and it's just yeah it's just not going away i'm not sure if it maybe even gotten a little worse from when i first noticed it
[doctor] okay and how long did you say it's going on for
[patient] probably about
[doctor] six eight weeks maybe
[patient] okay and do you have any pain in your foot no no no pain at all okay now i know that you're a diabetic and you are on some insulin have your sugars been running okay yeah they have been running

[doctor] your sugars are running higher than normal okay do you recall what your last hemoglobin a1c was was it above nine
[patient] yes it it it definitely was higher than nine
[doctor] okay alright now what do you think caused this ulcer were you wearing some tight fitting shoes or did you have some trauma to your foot or
[patient] yeah i was you know i think initially i'm you know i was out in the backyard you know kind of you know doing some work and you know i know i you know i could've stepped on a nail or you know there was some other work but you know i'm always outside so i do n't know if that kind of led to anything or caused anything
[doctor] okay alright and have you had any fever or chills
[patient] no no no fever or chills you know i kinda you know get headaches pretty often i do n't know if that you know i do n't know if that's a stress or but you know always have like the tension headaches in the front
[doctor] okay and do you have do you have neuropathy where you get like numbing and tingling in your feet
[patient] occasionally yeah occasionally especially when it's like colder outside
[doctor] mm-hmm kinda feels like it takes a little longer to
[patient] warm up but yeah i kinda have some sensation in in all my extremities
[doctor] okay alright and then are you are you a smoker or did you smoke
[patient] i did back you know kind of years ago i did but yeah i have n't smoked anything in in good number of years
[doctor] okay alright when did you stop smoking
[patient] couple years ago maybe four or so years ago
[doctor] okay alright and how many packs a day would you smoke
[patient] gosh back then yeah was at least two

[patient] yeah at least twenty yeah twenty plus years
[doctor] okay alright now any other symptoms do you have any problems when you walk down the street do you get any pain in your calves at all when you walk
[patient] no no no no pain you know just kind of you know it's just i know that it's there
[doctor] okay and you said you're active you're out in the yard and things like that do you go on long walks at all or no
[patient] no no you know it's you know i just kinda feel like i've been just trying to take it easy lately
[doctor] mm-hmm
[patient] but yeah most most of the stuff i've been doing is just kind of hanging around the house
[doctor] okay alright so we talked a little bit about your diabetes let's talk about your heart disease now your heart disease you had a heart attack in twenty eighteen we put a stent into your right coronary artery you're still taking your medications for that you're still on your aspirin
[patient] i am yes yeah i do the baby aspirin every day
[doctor] okay alright and any chest pain or shortness of breath or anything like that no no yeah no nothing more than yeah i would n't attribute anything
[patient] okay and do you have a podiatrist for your yearly foot exams
[doctor] no i i i do n't okay alright alright well let's go ahead i wan na just do a quick physical exam i'm just gon na be calling out some of my exam findings so your vital signs here in the office you do n't have any fever so that's good your blood pressure is great it's like one twenty seven over eighty and your heart rate is nice and slow in the sixties on your neck exam i do n't appreciate any jugular venous distention or any carotid bruits on your lung exam your lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally on your heart exam you do have a two out of six systolic ejection murmur heard at the left base and on your lower extremity exam i do n't appreciate any palpable dorsalis pedis or posterior tibial pulses there is a two by three centimeter ulcerated lesion on the right lateral foot near the fifth metacarpal metatarsophalangeal joint there is no associated cellulitis does it hurt when i press here
[patient] no
[doctor] there is no pain to palpation of the right foot there is associated granulation tissue and some slight purulent discharge from the wound okay so what does all that mean that just means that you have this ulcer that's you know fairly sizable with i think we need to do some good wound care on it let's talk a little bit about my assessment and plan so you know i you have a nonhealing ulcer of your right foot so we need to do some studies on you to see if you have an adequate blood supply to heal this foot wound and since you since you probably do n't because of your diabetes you're here in a vascular surgeon's office we may have to go ahead and talk about being able to open up some of your arteries to improve the blood supply to your foot so that might mean getting a stent to one of your arteries in your legs to open up the blood supply it might mean mean that we might have to do some bypass surgery to to improve the blood supply to your foot in order to heal that that wound i do think that you'll be able to heal it i do n't think that we need to do anything drastic i want you to continue with your aspirin because that will help
[patient] any questions
[doctor] yeah i mean is this do we have to do any more tests or anything what are you we're gon na do an arterial ultrasound i'm going to go ahead and order an arterial ultrasound of your lower extremities to see what the blood supply is like and then i'm gon na go ahead and order a podiatry consult because i want them to see this wound and improve the wound care that you're doing and then for your next problem your diabetes i wan na go ahead and talk to your primary care physician we need to get your diabetes better controlled because that impacts your wound healing as well okay
[patient] sure
[doctor] sure understood alright and for your last issue your coronary artery disease continue with your statin and i will talk to your cardiologist in case you need a procedure to see if you're cleared from a medical standpoint okay
[patient] okay perfect
[doctor] alright

[doctor] even with exertion
[patient] even with exertion
[doctor] okay do you have any swelling in your lower extremities at all that you noticed
[patient] not if i'm on my feet for a long time i'll notice a little bit of swelling but otherwise no
[doctor] okay and then a couple other family history questions anybody in the family have kidney disease or significant high blood pressure
[patient] both my parents do have high blood pressure and one of them did have kidney disease
[doctor] okay okay and in the the the form that you filled out when you came in it says that you are on ten milligrams of norvasc daily and carvedilol twenty five milligrams twice a day is those the medicines you're on
[patient] yes i was also on lisinopril before but with the adjustments yeah those are the ones i'm on
[doctor] okay and so here's where i think we are going to go do you take any nonsteroidals like advil or motrin or aleve
[patient] yeah just once in a while for my like any knee pain or back pain that i have but again not like everyday
[doctor] okay and then lastly what kind of alcohol intake do you have you know do you consider how many drinks a week is really what i'm looking for
[patient] i'll have a couple of beers during the week and like one or two on the weekends
[doctor] okay okay so lem me do a quick physical examination so i looked at your vitals when you came in today and your blood pressure it's still high it's one sixty nine over seventy four your heart rate was eighty eight and your oxygenation was ninety eight percent so those are all fairly good except that blood pressure's a little higher than we'd like to see now when i look at your neck i do n't see any jugular vein distention and i'm gon na listen here real quick no i do n't hear any carotid bruits i'm gon na listen to your lungs okay your lungs are clear and let me listen quickly to your heart i do hear that a two over six systolic ejection murmur and we'll we're gon na have to take a little bit look extra look at that that's when i i can hear an extra sound when i'm listening to your heart and you do have a small amount of one plus pitting edema bilaterally now i did so you do have that your diagnosis is uncontrolled hypertension you know and i think you're aware that that's what your your physician's been treating you for and most of the time this cause is is the cause of this is multifactorial it's not that there is just one thing causing it so we may need to be changing your medicine around and i'm gon na talk to your doctor but first thing before we make any more medication changes i want to order some tests first to rule out if there is any specific cause for this so first order will be a renal artery ultrasound and what i'm looking for there is that there is no areas of areas of narrowing in the the blood vessels of your kidneys that would be the cause of your hypertension in addition to that i'm gon na order a you get another urine collection some morning aldosterone levels reining levels and a twenty four hour urine and these things can really show me if there is any problems with your adrenal glands again this is a lot of big words but you know i'm i i'll write this all out for you i want you to decrease your alcohol i know you like those beers but let's bring it down to maybe one a week or two a week just to get those down lower and then your salt intake you need to be very judicious about decreasing that salt intake i'm gon na give you a referral to a nutritionist to discuss those changes for that you need and and they will help you get that cleared up and then finally stop taking any nonsteroidal medicines such as your advil or motrin the only thing i really want to want you taking is tylenol for any pain right now i am gon na prescribe one medicine and that's cardura four milligrams and i want you to take that once a day and that's good to see if that can help us with your blood pressure and then finally three weeks i'd like you to return i want you to record all of your blood pressures that you take over the next three weeks and bring them into the office but most importantly if you can try to take them at the same time everyday that would be beneficial for me any questions for me
[patient] no i i just it's a lot so i i'm hoping this will work and this will get it under control
[doctor] yeah i i think you know this will be you know this we're gon na spend some time together so i'm glad to have you as a patient but you know we got ta try to get this under control and i'm gon na i'll be talking to your pcp just to let them know that you know what my plans are and we'll stay real in sync on treating this as we move forward does that sound like a plan

MEDICAL NOTE:

CHIEF COMPLAINT

Left arm pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

He reports that his left arm pain began approximately 2 weeks ago. He woke around 2:00 am with intense pain in his left arm and hand. He applied ice and after 2-3 hours, the pain improved and he was able to go back to sleep, the pain did not return until that evening. After several nights of experiencing the left arm and hand pain, he was seen by Betty Ross, PA-C. She suspected a pinched nerve and completed x-rays of the cervical spine, prescribed gabapentin and prednisone, and referred the patient to us. The patient has benefited from the gabapentin and prednisone, reporting improvement of pain at night.

The pain initially was encountered at night, but the patient notes that the symptoms carry into the next day. He denies pain when moving his neck, turning his head, and moving his shoulder.

Mr. Clark does report a history of a left finger injury, stating “it rarely works”, and neuropathy in one leg from his knee to his foot which he receives 1% disability for. The patient is a veteran.

PAST HISTORY

Medical
Peripheral neuropathy.

SOCIAL HISTORY

The patient is a veteran and receives 1% disability.

CURRENT MEDICATIONS

Gabapentin tablet.
Prednisone tablet.

PHYSICAL EXAM

Constitutional
Elderly Caucasian male in no apparent distress. Presents in wheelchair.

Neurologic
Upper extremities: 1+ bilateral biceps, triceps, brachioradialis, reflexes bilaterally, negative. Negative Hoffman's
Gait: Not assessed today.

Strength
Upper extremities: Normal throughout the biceps, triceps, deltoid, grip strength, and finger abduction, bilaterally.
Sensation: Intact to light touch throughout the upper and lower extremities.

Musculoskeletal
Cervical: Nontender over cervical spine. Mildly restricted cervical extension and right and left lateral rotation, which is symmetric, which gives him mild lateral neck pain, but no radicular pain. Spurling's maneuver is benign.

RESULTS

X-ray Cervical Spine, 06/04/2021.
Impression: Significant disc degeneration at C5-6 and to a lesser extent C4-5 and C3-4. Significant lower facet arthropathy. C6-7 and C7-T1 are difficult to visualize in the current x-rays.

ASSESSMENT

• Left upper extremity neuropathy, suspicious for cervical radiculopathy, possible contribution of peripheral neuropathy
• Neck pain in the setting of arthritis and disc generation

PLAN

I suspect that this is a flare of cervical radiculopathy. I am going to set him up for a cervical MRI. We will tentatively plan for a left C7-T1 epidural afterwards, although the exact level will be pending the MRI results. He will continue his home exercise program as well as twice daily gabapentin. We will follow up with him afterwards to determine his level of relief. He denies any blood thinners.

This plan was discussed in detail with the patient who is in agreement.

INSTRUCTIONS

Continue home exercise program and twice daily gabapentin. Schedule MRI and epidural injection. Follow-up after epidural.

---------------------------------------------","[doctor] dictating on donald clark . date of birth , 03/04/1937 . chief complaint is left arm pain . hello , how are you ?
[patient] good morning .
[doctor] it's nice to meet you . i'm dr. miller .
[patient] it's nice to meet you as well .
[doctor] so , i hear you are having pain this arm . is that correct ?
[patient] that's correct .
[doctor] okay . and it seems like it's worse at night ?
[patient] well , right now the hand is .
[doctor] mm-hmm .
[patient] and the thing started about two weeks ago . i woke up about two o'clock in the morning and it was just hurting something awful .
[doctor] uh- .
[patient] and then i laid some ice on it and it finally did ease up .
[doctor] okay , that's good .
[patient] so i got up , i sat on the side of the bed and held my arm down , thinking it would , like , help the circulation , but it did n't .
[doctor] okay , i see .
[patient] and so , after a while , when it eased off , maybe about four , five am , i laid back down and it did n't start up again .
[doctor] mm-hmm , okay .
[patient] um . i went back to sleep but for several nights this happened , like , over and over . so , i finally went to see the doctor , and i do n't really recall her name .
[doctor] okay . yeah , i think i know who you're talking about , though .
[patient] um , she's the one who sent me to you , so , i , i would , i would think so . but when i went to her after the third time it happened and she checked me out , she said it was most likely coming from a pinched nerve .
[doctor] probably . uh , do you notice that moving your neck or turning your head seems to bother your arm ?
[patient] uh , no .
[doctor] okay . is moving your shoulder uncomfortable at all ?
[patient] no .
[doctor] and do you notice it at other times besides during the night ?
[patient] um , some days . if it bothers me at night , then the day following , it usually will bother me some .
[doctor] okay . and do you just notice it in the hand , or does it seem to be going down the whole arm ?
[patient] well , it starts there and goes all the way down the arm .
[doctor] okay . have you noticed any weakness in your hand at all ?
[patient] uh , yes .
[doctor] okay . like , in terms of gripping things ?
[patient] yeah .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] uh , this finger , i hurt it some time ago as well .
[doctor] really ?
[patient] yeah . it does n't work properly . or , it works very rarely .
[doctor] gotcha . and did i hear that she gave you some prednisone and some oral steroids , or ?
[patient] uh , well , she gave me some numbing medicine . it helped a little bit . the other two were a neck pill and gabapentin . uh , you should have my full list in your notes , though . since then it has n't really bothered me at night . also , just so you know , i am a va and i'm one percent disabled from this leg , um , issues from my knees down to my feet .
[doctor] okay . is it neuropathy ?
[patient] uh , yep .
[doctor] gotcha . that is good to know . all right , well , let's go ahead and take a look .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] all right . so , to start , i'm gon na have you do something for me . uh , just go ahead and tilt your chin as far as you can down to your chest . okay , good . and now , go the other way , tilting your chin up as far as you can . now , does that seem to bother you at all ? okay . and now , come back to normal , just look and turn your head as far as you can that way . great . and now , as far as you can towards that wall . uh , does that seem to bother you at all ?
[patient] no . well , actually , i do feel a little strain .
[doctor] okay . so , you feel it in the neck a little bit ?
[patient] yeah , just a little strain .
[doctor] okay . uh , now squeeze my fingers as hard as you can with both hands . great . now , hold your arms like this .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] and i'm going to try to strain your arms and try to keep them as stiff as you can . do n't let me strain it . okay , good . good . now , when i , i'm just touching your hands like this . does it seem to feel about the same in both hands ?
[patient] uh , yes .
[doctor] okay . all right . so , i do agree with betty . uh , more than likely , this seems like it would be coming from your neck . that's the most common reason that causes what , what you're experiencing . and i looked at an x-ray of your neck , and you do seem to have a lot of arthritis there , and there does seem to be potential for a disc to be pushing on a nerve . and now , what i do n't have is an mri , which would show me , uh , kind of exactly where the nerve roots are getting pinched off .
[patient] i see .
[doctor] so , gabapentin can help a little bit with the nerve pain , and what i would like to do is potentially set you up for an epidural . and what that is is it , it's a focused anti-inflammatory medicine , excuse me , that works behind the nerve roops that , nerve roots that we are thinking might be getting squished off . it can often help alleviate your symptoms , and i do need to get an mri of your neck . um , i know we have had one of your lower back , but i need one of your neck to see exactly where the roots are getting pinched off . so , what i can do is tentatively set you up for an epidural , but before you do that , we do need to get that mri so i can see right where i need to put the medicine for your epidural . uh , what do you think of that ?
[patient] i think that sounds good to me .
[doctor] okay , good . and just to confirm , do you take any blood thinners ? i do n't think i saw any on your medicine list .
[patient] uh , no , i do n't .
[doctor] okay , good . and what i would have you do is continue with the gabapentin . um , are you taking 300 or 100 ?
[patient] um , not sure . my lady friend helps me handle this stuff .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] i am taking eliquis , though .
[doctor] okay . um , so whatever you are doing you can just keep doing it , and i'm going to set you up for the epidural and imaging study , um , just so i know right where to put the medicine . and i will follow up with you after s- um , that's in . we can do the shot , just to make sure your arm is feeling better . sound good ?
[patient] sounds good . for the last couple of nights , though , my neck has not been bothering me .
[doctor] okay . s- um , so , presumably what's happening , then , is when you're sleeping your neck is kind of gets off-tilt , uh , kilter , and it compresses the nerve roots there . now , if you think you're doing fine , we could hold off , but at the very la- least , i'd like to update that mri of yours and see what's going on , because probably this is something that will likely flare up again .
[patient] yeah , it , it has been for the last week , so , i understand .
[doctor] okay . all right . well , do you want to do that work-up and do the epidural , or do you think you're doing fine and you want to wait ?
[patient] well , my hand is still bothering me .
[doctor] okay . so , you're saying your neck is not bothering you but the hand is . okay . so then , let's just stick with the plan . mri of the neck , so we can see where the nerve roots may be compressed , that's giving your hand the issue . and then , we're going to set you up with the epidural .
[patient] okay . sounds good .
[doctor] all right . so , keep going with the gabapentin . i will order the imaging of your neck , and the shot will hopefully help some with those symptoms in your hand , and then we'll follow up afterwards .
[patient] all right . is the mri today ?
[doctor] um , you probably ca n't do it today , but let me talk with roy and see how soon we can get it done . just give me a quick minute , and then roy will come in and get things scheduled as soon as we can .

MEDICAL NOTE:

CHIEF COMPLAINT

Smoking cessation.

MEDICAL HISTORY

Patient reports a history of type 2 diabetes, gout, and a 2/6 Systolic ejection murmur.

SOCIAL HISTORY

Patient reports he is a smoker.

MEDICATIONS

Patient reports taking allopurinol.

VITALS

Oxygen Saturation: 98% on room air.
Blood Pressure: 128/88 mmHg.
Heart Rate: 68 beats per minute.
Respiratory Rate: 16 breaths per minute.

PHYSICAL EXAM

Neck
- General Examination: Neck is supple without lymphadenopathy. No carotid bruits.

Respiratory
- Auscultation of Lungs: Clear bilaterally. No expiratory wheezes, rales, or rhonchi.

Cardiovascular
- Auscultation of Heart: Regular rate. 2/6 systolic ejection murmur.

Hematology/Lymphatic/Immunology
- Palpation: No enlarged lymph nodes.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

1. Nicotine dependence.
- Medical Reasoning: The patient has a long history of smoking cigarettes. He is currently smoking 1.5 packs per day. He is highly motivated to cease smoking as he is preparing to become a father.
- Patient Education and Counseling: I applaud the patient on making this first step to stop smoking. I reassured him that with absolute 100% certainty that I will be with him every step of the way. I explained to the patient that stress can often be a trigger for smoking. He received handouts today for common smoking triggers. I advised him to be watchful and monitor his stress level, not only regarding work, but also his impending fatherhood. The patient and I discussed coping mechanisms for when he encounters stressful situations. I encouraged him to maintain his gym routine, engage in meditation, and try adding in yoga to help further reduce his stress levels. We discussed additional cessation aids.
- Medical Treatment: The patient has chosen his birthday, as a quit date. On that day, I am going to start him with a 21 mg nicotine patch, and the goal will be to decrease that over time. We will work together to decrease the dosage of the nicotine patch, so there are not necessarily any hard dates in mind. I recommend he change the patch location each day as that will help reduce or avoid any skin irritation that can occur if he re-uses the same location repeatedly.

2. Type 2 diabetes.
- Medical Reasoning: Stable.
- Patient Education and Counseling: We discussed that continuing to follow a healthy diet and perform regular exercise will help to maintain his blood glucose levels.
- Medical Treatment: We will continue to monitor his type 2 diabetes. Hemoglobin A1c is ordered to be completed by his next visit in 2 weeks.

3. History of gout.
- Medical Reasoning: Stable with medication.
- Patient Education and Counseling: I advised him to continue to watch for foods that will exacerbate his uric acid levels.
- Medical Treatment: He will continue his allopurinol.

Patient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.

INSTRUCTIONS

I would like to see him again in 2 weeks to discuss how things are going and to reevaluate the nicotine patch dosage.

Examination of gait: Heel-walk and toe-walk are intact.
Cervical spine exam: No tenderness is elicited. Range of motion is full in all planes without pain. Spurling's test is negative.
Lumbar spine exam: Range of motion is decreased in extension and lateral flexion without pain. No tenderness is elicited in the midline.
Sacroiliac joint exam: Bilateral sacroiliac joints are nontender to palpation.
Bilateral hip exam: Range of motion is decreased in the right hip with pain in the groin on internal and external rotation. Resisted right hip flexion causes pain in the right groin region. Bilateral trochanteric regions are nontender to palpation.

Neurological
Motor bulk and tone are normal in both lower extremities. Motor strength testing reveals no focal motor weakness in the lower extremities. Deep tendon reflexes are 1+ throughout. No focal sensory deficit is noted.

RESULTS

MR arthrogram of the right hip completed on 06/03/2021 reveals evidence of high-grade chondromalacia involving the anterosuperior right acetabulum with subchondral marrow edema and cyst formation.

ASSESSMENT

• Right hip degenerative joint disease.

PLAN

I discussed the clinical and radiological findings with the patient. Treatment options discussed are low impact exercises, use of analgesics as needed, and use of a cane to offload the right hip. She would like to proceed with a cortisone injection into her right hip joint. We will administer the injection today. I reviewed the procedure in detail, including the risks of the injection related to the use of steroid in the COVID setting. She understands the risks and would like to proceed with the injection.

INSTRUCTIONS

Schedule a follow up appointment in 3 months to assess her pain. If needed, a second injection may be administered.","[doctor] good morning ms. reyes !

[doctor] cough okay is it any mucus with it or is it a dry cough
[patient] more dry
[doctor] a dry cough okay and tell me more about this sore throat
[patient] this kind of seems to be persistent comes and goes it will be worse sometimes and then others it feels better trying to drink lots of fluids

[patient] yes i have n't had any nausea but you know just slight fatigue it does n't seem to be overwhelming
[doctor] okay okay so we are gon na go ahead if it's okay with you and start your physical exam reviewing your vitals so vitals look good especially your oxygen especially with the chemotherapy you've been getting and the cough so your oxygen looks good so i'm happy with that so now i'm just examining your neck especially with your sore throat and i do n't appreciate any cervical lymphadenopathy and also no supraclavicular adenopathy listening to your heart you have a nice regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs that i appreciate now on your lung exam when you're taking some deep breaths i do notice some crackles in your lungs bilaterally and what that means is there is there is some faint sounds that i'm hearing which could represent some fluid there so on looking at your skin exam on your chest you do have some erythema on the anterior side of the chest on the left side and this could be related to the radiation so on your lower extremities i appreciate no edema and everything else looks good and thank you i know you did a chest x-ray before coming in so on your results for the chest x-ray it does look like you have some mild radiation pneumonitis which basically means some inflammation of the lungs most likely due to the radiation so what does this all mean so for your assessment and plan so for the first diagnosis the first problem of the lung cancer so what we're gon na do is we're gon na continue with the current regimen of your chemotherapy of the cisplacin and the etoside and we're gon na continue with your current dose of radiation at forty five grade and when that's complete we will repeat some imaging and hopefully you know the tumor will shrink down enough that we can remove it surgically okay for problem number two so the radiation pneumonitis so that's what causing that cough as well as some of the shortness of breath i know you're not experiencing it much now so what i'm gon na do for that is actually gon na prescribe you a low dose of prednisone and so that's an will help with the inflammation i'm gon na give you forty milligrams daily for five days and so hopefully that will help reduce the inflammation and so that you can continue with the radiation okay how does that sound so far
[patient] that sounds great thank you
[doctor] okay and then lastly for the painful swallowing that you're having so the inflammation you're having it not only in your lungs but it also in your esophagus as well so what i'm gon na do is prescribe you you're taking the the prednisone i'm also gon na give you a lidocaine swish and swallow and you can do that four times a day and so that will be able to help you so you can eat immediately after taking it and it can also help so that you can continue to take food and fluids prevent dehydration and any further weight loss

Chief Complaint: right ductal carcinoma in situ
Secondary Complaints: none

---------------------------------------------
MEDICAL NOTE:

CHIEF COMPLAINT

History of right ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS).

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Sophia Brown is a 75 y.o. female who presents today for a new patient evaluation due to her history of right DCIS. She is doing well but wishes to establish care today for continued monitoring.

The patient underwent a screening mammogram in 10/2019 and was found to have a calcification in the right breast. She then had a right breast ultrasound on 11/03/2019 which revealed a mass at the 2 o’clock position, 11 cm from the nipple, in the retroareolar region. The report states the mass was 0.4 by 2.0 by 3.0 centimeters. She subsequently had an ultrasound-guided core needle biopsy on 12/05/2019 and pathology results revealed grade 2 ER-positive, PR-positive DCIS. The patient then had a lumpectomy with lymphadenectomy performed on 01/20/2020. The tumor was 8 mm with negative margins and the 5 lymph nodes removed were all benign. Pathology from the tumor confirmed DCIS. Her lumpectomy was followed by adjuvant radiation therapy. Endocrine therapy was also offered but the patient declined. She has since had a mammogram in 01/2021 which was normal. The patient also reports that she performs self-breast exams regularly at home.

Mrs. Brown is a G5P5 female and estimates that her last menstrual period was approximately 30 years ago. She is not currently and has never been on hormone replacement therapy.

The patient’s last colonoscopy was done in 2018. She had a sigmoid polypectomy at that time and pathology showed a tubular adenoma.

Her cholesterol was recently noted to be elevated and the patient reports that she is exercising and reducing fatty food intake accordingly. This is being followed by her primary care provider.

PAST HISTORY

[doctor] hello , ms. brown .
[patient] hi . yes , that's me .
[doctor] wonderful . i'm doctor stewart . it's lovely to meet you .
[patient] you as well .
[doctor] so , you've come to see me today because you had a right breast lumpectomy last year . is that right ?
[patient] yes . on january 20th , 2020 .
[doctor] okay . and how have you been since then ? any problems or concerns ?
[patient] no , i'm feeling good . i do my self breast exams religiously now and have n't felt anything since .
[doctor] perfect . i want to back up and go over your history so i can make sure everything in your chart is correct and i do n't miss anything . so , i'll tell you what we have in your chart from your other providers and you tell me if anything is wrong or missing . sound good ?
[patient] sounds good .
[doctor] great . so , i have that you were found to have a calcification in your right breast during a mammogram in october 2019 . was that just a normal screening mammogram , or was it done because you felt a lump ?
[patient] it was just a normal one you're supposed to get every so often .
[doctor] i see . and then it looks like you had an ultrasound of your right breast on november 3rd , 2019 , which revealed a mass at the two o'clock position , 11 centimeters from the nipple in the retroareolar region . the report states the mass was point four by two by three centimeters .
[patient] yes , that sounds right . hard to remember now , though .
[doctor] yep , definitely .
[doctor] based on those results , they decided to do an ultrasound-guided core needle biopsy on december 5th , 2019 . pathology results during that biopsy came back as grade two , er positive , pr positive , dcis , or ductal carcinoma in situ .
[patient] yes . unfortunately .
[doctor] i know . scary stuff . but you had a lumpectomy on january 20th , 2020 , which removed the eight millimeter tumor and margins were negative . the pathology confirmed dcis . looks like they also removed 5 lymph nodes , which , thankfully , were negative for malignancy . that's great !
[patient] yeah , i was definitely very relieved .
[doctor] and your last mammogram was in january 2021 ? and that was normal .
[patient] yes .
[doctor] okay . so , i feel like i have a good grasp of what's been going on with you now . and you're here today to establish care with me so i can continue to follow you and make sure you're doing well , right ?
[patient] yes . fingers crossed .
[doctor] definitely . we'll keep a close eye on you and take good care of you .
[patient] okay , sounds good .
[doctor] i have a few more questions for you . when was your last colonoscopy ?
[patient] i had one in 2018 and , if i remember correctly , i had one polyp and that was removed and it was n't cancerous .
[doctor] okay , yes , i see that report now . one polyp in the sigmoid colon which had a benign tubular adenoma . okay . and when was your last menstrual period ?
[patient] gosh . it was probably around 30 years ago .
[doctor] okay . do you have children ?
[patient] i do . i have five .
[doctor] ah , big family then . that's nice .
[patient] yes . and they're all having kids of their own now , so it's getting even bigger .
[doctor] i bet . sounds like fun .
[patient] it is .
[doctor] did you have any other pregnancies that were miscarriages or terminations ?
[patient] really , i did not .
[doctor] okay . so for the record , that's g5 p5 . and now that you're post-menopausal , are you currently or have you ever been on hormone replacement therapy ?
[patient] my primary care doctor gave me the option years ago but i decided against it .
[doctor] okay . and on your review systems form , you indicated that you've not had any recent weight loss or gain , headaches , bone pain , urinary symptoms , or blood in the stools . but you did indicate that you have some back pain , joint pain , and high cholesterol . tell me some more about those .
[patient] okay . so i've seen doctors for all of those . they've said , excuse me , the back and knee pain are age-related . and the cholesterol is a fairly new diagnosis , but i am working on exercise and cutting back on fatty foods to see if i can get it lower without any medication .
[doctor] okay . and your primary care doctor is following you for that , right ?
[patient] that's correct .
[doctor] okay . for medications , i have that you take coq10 , vitamin d , vitamin c , fish oil , and elderberry fruit . is that all right ?
[patient] yes , and that's all .
[doctor] okay . so for your medical history , it's high cholesterol and stage 0 er/pr positive invasive ductal carcinoma of the right breast . any surgeries other than the lumpectomy ?
[patient] i did have my tubes tied after my last baby , but that's all .
[doctor] okay . and how about family history ?
[patient] my mom had non-hodgkin's lymphoma and my dad had prostate cancer and heart disease , but i think that's it .
[doctor] all right . any family history of breast cancer ?
[patient] none .
[doctor] did any of your children have medical issues or siblings with medical problems ?
[patient] i do not have any siblings and , thankfully , my children are all healthy .
[doctor] wonderful . do you have any history of smoking , illicit drug use , heavy alcohol consumption ?
[patient] no drugs . i do drink socially , but never more than that . and i used to smoke , but really , everybody did back then and i probably quit about 30 years ago .
[doctor] excellent . i have that you're allergic to penicillin . any other allergies ?
[patient] nope , just penicillin .
[doctor] okay . i think that covers it . hop up here and let me take a look at you .
[doctor] okay , so let's use the normal new patient exam template . only change to make is the breast exam . there are no palpable masses , however , there is skin thickening at the medial inferior aspect of the right breast which may be radiation skin changes .
[doctor] in the result section , note that her ecog performance status today is zero .
[doctor] do you have ... did you have radiation after the lumpectomy ?
[patient] i did . we also talked about endocrine therapy , but i decided against that .
[doctor] okay . so your exam looks good , no masses , just some skin changes from that radiation . now , let's go over the plan for you .
[patient] okay , sounds good .
[doctor] as you know , you've had dcis which we'll list in my note as stage zero , er/pr positive , invasive ductal carcinoma of the right breast . your status post-lumpectomy with removal of five lymph nodes that were benign . you also had , um , radiation therapy but declined endocrine therapy . today's clinical examination shows no evidence of recurrence with the dcis or other malignancy and your mammogram in january , 2021 was also negative for recurrence and malignancy .
[doctor] so , based on all of that , we can just continue to observe you .
[patient] okay . that sounds great . and when do i come back in to see you ?
[doctor] in a year , but you should have another mammogram in april of 2022 before you come back to see me .
[patient] okay , i can do that .
[doctor] wonderful . i'm glad to see you doing so well . do you have any questions or concerns i can address for you today ?
[patient] i do n't think so .
[doctor] okay , great . my nurse will be in shortly to discharge you . take care !

Chief Complaint: right elbow pain
Secondary Complaints: nan

MEDICAL NOTE:

CHIEF COMPLAINT

Right elbow pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Lawrence Butler is a pleasant 45-year-old male who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of right elbow pain.

Over the past week, the patient has developed 6/10 pain in the ""inside"" of his right elbow. The pain may radiate into his forearm on occasion, but does not extend up to his shoulder. He denies any history of trauma or injury, but he did start making pottery during the COVID-19 pandemic and suspects that his symptoms could be related to that. His symptoms affect his ability to lift objects or perform his typical activities of daily living. Ibuprofen provides minimal symptomatic relief.

SOCIAL HISTORY

The patient reports that he began making pottery during the COVID-19 pandemic.

MEDICATIONS

The patient reports that he has been taking ibuprofen.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Musculoskeletal: Reports right elbow pain.

VITALS

Normal

PHYSICAL EXAM

MSK: Examination of the right elbow: Moderate tenderness at the medial epicondyle. No pain with supination of the forearm. Pain with pronation of the forearm. Pain with resistance against flexion of the wrist.

RESULTS

X-ray imaging of the right elbow was obtained and reviewed in office today. These reveal no evidence of fracture or bony abnormality.

ASSESSMENT

Right medial epicondylitis.

PLAN

The patient and I discussed his diagnosis in detail, and I explained that his symptoms are likely caused by overuse and potential damage of the tendons. We will provide him with sling to be worn during the day while he is awake. I want him to take ibuprofen 600 mg every 6 hours with food for a full week and ice the elbow for 20 minutes, 3 times daily. Finally, I advised the patient to rest his elbow and avoid doing any pottery for the next couple of weeks.

INSTRUCTIONS

The patient will follow up in 1 week.

---------------------------------------------","[doctor] hey lawrence how're you doing

[doctor] okay and then and how long has this pain been going on
[patient] about four days now
[doctor] alright and anything you've done to help relieve or alleviate that pain any anything that that's giving you relief
[patient] i've tried ibuprofen that helps a little but not much

[patient] and i've been in a lot of pain it started about i would say probably about three days ago
[doctor] okay
[patient] started having pain on my left back
[doctor] okay
[patient] and since then i continued to have pain it is traveling a little lower it's gotten little low but i definitely have not passed it yet and i'm just in so much pain
[doctor] okay so is the pain that you're having is it constant or does it come and go
[patient] it's constant
[doctor] okay
[patient] all the time i ca n't get comfortable
[doctor] alright are you able to urinate
[patient] i am and this morning i actually started seeing some blood
[doctor] okay yeah so and i know you said i see you've had some kidney stones in the past like how many times would you say you've had one of these episodes
[patient] i've had it for probably this might be my third time
[doctor] third time alright
[patient] yeah i have n't had one in a while but yeah this is my third time
[doctor] okay so have you noticed any nausea chills fever
[patient] no fever some chills and i i just in so much pain i i ca n't eat and i do feel a little nauseous
[doctor] okay that sound definitely understandable so you've been in a lot of pain so have you tried to take any medications to alleviate the pain
[patient] yeah i've been taking tylenol i have had to try some ibuprofen i know you said to be careful with my blood pressure but i have been trying to do that because i'm just in so much pain and it's not really working
[doctor] okay and before what would you how long would you say it took you to pass the other stones or how was that that resolved
[patient] yeah usually usually about about three four days to pass it yeah
[doctor] right so this is this is the looks like this is the third day
[patient] yeah
[doctor] so we are getting close there
[patient] okay
[doctor] yeah so hopefully we can pass it but we'll i'll definitely we can take a look at it here in a second so while you are here i also wanted to check up on your your diabetes and and hypertension you have so i'm looking here at my notes and you're on two . five of norvasc for your high blood pressure when you came in today your blood pressure was a was a little bit high and i know that's probably because you are in a bunch of pain so that definitely makes sense but i think last time we talked a little bit about you getting a blood pressure cuff and taking your blood pressures regularly so those readings first off were you able to get the blood pressure cuff
[patient] i was i have n't been great about taking it but i did get the blood pressure cuff
[doctor] so the time that you did take it and i think that's something we got to work on is you've taken them i think at least three times a week i would like you to what have those been running
[patient] like the top numbers they're usually the one thirties sometimes i get i do go into one forties and once it went to like one fifty
[doctor] okay
[patient] and then the bottom number has been between seventy and eighty okay that i mean that's not too bad i think when you were first diagnosed you were up there in the
[doctor] the one eighties which was really high
[patient] right
[doctor] so let me talk a little bit also about you trying to lower your salt intake to like like twenty three hundred milligrams a a day so have you been able to do that
[patient] trying my best but doc i really like my french fries
[doctor] yeah
[patient] like
[doctor] we we all like we all like the french fries you know but you know we we we we also do n't like strokes so we do n't want to have a scope and all the all the french fries so that's something definitely i would like you to work on and do you think you'd be able to to curb that french fry habit or that bad this bad food habits by yourself or do you think you need help
[patient] yeah some help could be helpful okay yeah we can definitely get you connected with someone just to help you with your diet kinda that's the biggest thing for a lot of my patient is trying to control that diet alright
[doctor] so i also want to take a look here at your diabetes and last time you came in your a1c was a little bit higher at seven . three and you're on five hundred of metformin currently so have you been taking your blood sugars before you eat everyday
[patient] i have and those those have been pretty good they are like in the low one hundreds
[doctor] okay that that that's definitely good because when you came in i think we did a glucose test on you couple of months ago and you were around three hundred which is which is pretty up there so i'm glad that you know those levels are down and have you been taking that metformin everyday
[patient] i do
[doctor] okay
[patient] i do take it
[doctor] that that that that's really good alright so let me do a quick physical exam on you just a couple of questions before i take a look at your your abdomen and and your back talked to take a look at that that kidney stones you're having so i just want to make sure are you having any any chest pain
[patient] no chest pain
[doctor] no chest pain are you having any belly pain
[patient] the back pain is starting to kind of go down into my groin but i would n't say any back pain i mean abdominal pain
[doctor] no abdominal pain alright so let me check here i'm gon na listen to your heart real quick and so on your heart exam i do hear a grade two out of six systolic ejection murmur and that we knew about that already so not really worried about that currently listen to your lungs your lungs are clear bilaterally i do n't hear any crackles or wheezes so let me press here on your abdomen does that hurt
[patient] yes
[doctor] okay i'm gon na press here on your back is that painful
[patient] yes
[doctor] alright so on your examination of your abdomen there is tenderness to palpation of the abdomen there is n't any rebound or guarding though and only there is also cva tinnitus on the right on your on your flank as well and so it seems to me you know that you do have that kidney stone looks like you do have some inflammation around your kidney that's what that that's that tenderness around your cva is is telling me so let's go talk a little bit about my assessment and plan for you so you know right now because of your history of of having kidney stones you you do have a kidney stone so what we're gon na do is first off i'm gon na get you some pain medication kinda you're in a ton of pain right now i'm gon na prescribe you some oxycodone five milligrams you can take that every six to eight hours as needed for pain and so hopefully that can help you feeling better and you can continue to take that tylenol for any breakthrough pain that you're having i do wan na make sure that you're pushing fluids right now because we need to try to push that stone out that you're having just kinda clear your kidneys and that that would definitely help i also want to give you a strainer so you can strain your urine to see if you do actually pass that stone and then i'm going to refer you to urology and we're actually i'm gon na have you you even if you pass a stone in the next couple of days i want you to go anyway because it seems like you're having recurrent kidney stones and so hopefully they can help do something to to help this from happening in the future for your hypertension i'm gon na keep you on that two . five norvasc your your blood pressures look good so i'm not gon na make any changes there and then for your diabetes we'll keep you on the five hundred of metformin and i also want to give you a referral to nutrition to a dietitian and they will be able to help you with your your diet i know you said you have a few issues so you know they can possibly write a diet for you and if you follow it you know hopefully in the future we can get you off of both of these medications and get you back to normal so how does that all sound

She has a history of heavy menstruation and a hysterectomy in 1996. She completed a colonoscopy 5-6 years ago with nonsignificant findings. She denies having a pacemaker, defibrillator, sleep apnea, or using oxygen.

Mrs. Cooper reports a myriad of symptoms, stating she feels fatigued often during the day, feverish with chills at times, and during activity feels she cannot catch her breath and some wheezing is present. She has been having some headaches which is uncommon for her. Additionally, she is noticing tingling sensations, cold sensitivity, and her anxiety and depression have worsened.

Drink’s alcohol 1-2 times per year.

CURRENT MEDICATIONS

Ferrous Sulfate 25 mg tablet twice per day (1 in the morning, 1 in the evening), Vitamin B12 OTC.

PHYSICAL EXAM

Gastrointestinal
Abdomen non-tender.

ASSESSMENT

• Iron deficiency anemia

Mrs. Cooper is a 65-year-old female who was diagnosed with iron deficiency anemia in 12/2019 and was unable to donate blood. Her follow-up blood work in 01/2020 revealed a low hemoglobin, stable hematocrit, and normal iron labs, although, ferritin was low. She has been taking ferrous sulfate 325 mg by mouth.

PLAN

I have asked her to continue each ferrous sulfate dose with vitamin C found in orange juice for the next 12 weeks then recheck CBC, iron ferritin, B-12, and folate. A referral was sent for her to see a hematologist. We will plan for EGD and colonoscopy to assess for potential sources of anemia or GI bleed. If this is inconclusive, capsule endoscopy can be considered.

INSTRUCTIONS

Schedule upper endoscopy, colonoscopy and appointment with hematologist. Return to the clinic if symptoms worsen.

---------------------------------------------","[doctor] today i'm seeing christina cooper . her date of birth is 07/01/1954 . uh , ms. cooper is a new patient who was referred by diane nelson for a long-standing iron deficiency anemia .
[doctor] hello , how are you ?
[patient] i'm good , thank you .
[doctor] so tell me what brings you in today .
[patient] recently i tried to donate blood , around december i think , and they told me i was anemic , which is something i've been dealing with for a while , so it's not the first time i've been told i'm anemic .
[doctor] or how have you been feeling in general with this ?
[patient] not great . i have been feeling fatigued often during the day , and even feverish with chills at times . when i try to be active i like i ca n't catch my breath and i feel like i'm wheezing . i've had some headaches too , which is not like me .
[doctor] okay . are there any other symptoms ?
[patient] i've been noting some chilling sensations . i also get cold so easily . it's annoying . i feel like i have to really bundle up . i do n't know if this is related but my anxiety and depression feel like it has been getting worse lately . i feel like a mess .
[doctor] sounds like you're not feeling great , obviously . and i'm glad you came to see us . um , we're certainly going to try to figure this out and figure out what's going on , uh , but it sounds like you've been dealing with this anemia for a long time ?
[patient] yeah , i've been anemic since i was 13 years old .
[doctor] right . so why do your doctors think you're anemic ? do you have a history of heavy periods ?
[patient] well i did have heavy periods until i had a hysterectomy in 1996 . but no , they have not told me why they think i'm anemic , which is frustrating honestly .
[doctor] yeah . i can imagine that is . um , let's see if we can help though . since you had your hysterectomy your periods , of course , are no longer the issue . um , when was your last colonoscopy ?
[patient] about five to six years ago .
[doctor] and was it relatively a normal exam ? did you have any polyps ?
[patient] no . they said they'd see me in 10 years .
[doctor] well that's good news .
[patient] yeah , i agree .
[doctor] um , do you have a pacemaker or defibrillator , or have sleep apnea , or use oxygen at night ?
[patient] no .
[doctor] all right . do you ever drink alcohol ?
[patient] yeah , but only once or twice a year .
[doctor] okay . are you taking any supplements such as iron or vitamin b12 ?
[patient] i already started taking my iron pills which i have not taken in about a year .
[doctor] all right . and what are you taking ?
[patient] i'm taking 25 milligram tablets , twice daily .
[doctor] okay , and that's the , the ferrous sulfate ?
[patient] yeah , that's it . i take one in the morning and one in the evening .
[doctor] okay . anything else ?
[patient] yeah , i take vitamin b12 , just the over the counter stuff .
[doctor] okay , very good . all right , well let's go ahead and take a look and see what's going on .
[patient] sounds good . thank you .
[doctor] of course . you'll hear me , uh , talk through your exam so that i get all the information documented .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] all right . so use my general physical exam template . i will start by listening to your heart and lungs .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] all right . next , i'd like you to lay back so i can examine your abdomen .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] is there any tenderness where i'm pressing ?
[patient] no .
[doctor] okay . you can sit up . so your physical exam is normal without any significant findings . all right ms. cooper , often when we initially see anemia and your host of symptoms , we suspect internal bleeding .
[patient] is that why they want me to have another upper endoscopy ?
[doctor] actually it would be an upper endoscopy and a colonoscopy , but yes , likely that's the reason why .
[patient] lovely .
[doctor] yeah . unfortunately our cameras do not meet all the way in the middle , so if those tests back , come , if those tests come back fine , then we'll have you swallow a pill camera to take pictures as it moves through your , uh , system .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] we may not need to , but it's just the first thing we can do to make sure that you're not losing blood . um , the second thing we can do is have you see a hematologist . they will tell us if you need to give any , to give you any intravenous iron , or maybe something to help your body store the iron better .
[patient] all right .
[doctor] so let's go ahead , get your upper endoscopy and colonoscopy scheduled .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] um , have you ever had any issue with sedation in the past ?
[patient] no , i was just sleepy afterwards .
[doctor] okay . well we will give you a bowel prep to clean out your bowels ahead of time . um , if we do these tests and they are normal , like i said , then we will consider that capsule endoscopy .
[patient] okay . sounds like a plan .
[doctor] all right . so after that you'll be all done and we will send you to the hematologist . additionally , i'm going to need you to start taking your iron pills with orange juice . uh , the vitamin c will help you absorb the iron better . do this for about 8-12 weeks , uh , and then we can reassess your blood work .
[patient] okay , that sounds great .
[doctor] all right . well i think we have our plan . on your way out , stop by and schedule your upper endoscopy and c- colonoscopy . uh , we will send a referral to dr. flores who is is the hematologist , so schedule that appointment . um , here are your instructions for the pre- uh , the bowel prep . uh , call us if you have any questions or worsening symptoms . we'll be happy to help you .
[patient] thank you .
[doctor] you're welcome . have a great day , have a great day ms. cooper .
[patient] you too .
[doctor] all right . this is christina cooper , pleasant 65 year old female who was diagnosed with iron deficiency anemia in 12-2019 , and w- and was unable to donate blood . um , her followup blood work on 01/20/20 was revealed a low hemoglobin , stable hematocrit and normal iron labs , although ferritin was low . um , she was taking ferrous sulfate , three hundred , twenty phil- 25 milligrams by mouth . i've asked her to continue each dose with vitamin c found in orange juice , for the next 12 weeks , then recheck to the cbc , iron , ferritin , b12 , and folate . um , a referral was sent to her hematologist . we will plan for an egd and a colonoscopy to assess for potential sources of anemia or gi bleed . if this is inconclusive , capsule endoscopy will be considered . thanks .",2609.5,"Ferrous Sulfate 25 mg tablet twice per day (1 in the morning, 1 in the evening), Vitamin B12 OTC.",mistral_result, The patient is currently taking ferrous sulfate 25 milligrams twice daily and vitamin B12 supplements.,0.6,Bin 1

Chief Complaint: tick bite
Secondary Complaints: hypertension;type 2 diabetes

---------------------------------------------
MEDICAL NOTE:

CHIEF COMPLAINT

Tick bite.

MEDICAL HISTORY

Patient reports a history of arthritis, hypertension, and diabetes type 2.

SOCIAL HISTORY

Patient reports he enjoys spending time outside in the woods and working in the yard. He went hunting with his grandchildren a couple of weeks ago.

MEDICATIONS

Patient reports taking lisinopril 20 mg once a day and metformin 1000 mg twice daily most of the time.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Constitutional: Reports general ill feelings. Denies any fever, chills, flu like symptoms, body aches, or trouble waking.
Respiratory: Denies cough or shortness of breath.
Musculoskeletal: Denies joint pain or problems with ambulation.
Skin: Reports warmth on the right knee.
Neurological: Reports headache. Denies dizziness.

VITALS

Blood Pressure: 122/70 mmHg.
Heart Rate: 67 beats per minute.
Body Temperature: 98.4 degrees F.

PHYSICAL EXAM

Neck
- General Examination: Neck is supple without thyromegaly or lymphadenopathy.

Respiratory
- Auscultation of Lungs: Clear bilaterally.

Cardiovascular
- Auscultation of Heart: Regular rate and rhythm. No murmurs, gallops or rubs.

Musculoskeletal
- Examination of the right knee: Erythema and edema as well as an area of fluctuance noted over the right patella. There is pain to palpation of the right anterior knee. Full range of motion.

Integumentary
- Examination: There is evidence of a bull’s eye rash over the right knee.

RESULTS

Patient's previous kidney function is within normal limits.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

1. Tick bite.
- Medical Reasoning: My concern is that he might have Lyme disease based on the presentation of his right knee.
- Patient Education and Counseling: The patient and I discussed blood testing to determine if he does in fact have Lyme disease. I explained that Lyme disease can cause problems with other organs if not treated appropriately. We discussed that sometimes antibiotics need to be administered intravenously if oral antibiotics are not given early enough. We will see how he does with a course of oral antibiotics as I would like to avoid intravenous antibiotics.
- Medical Treatment: Prescription for doxycycline 100 mg twice a day for 3 weeks provided. Lyme titer and Western blot will be obtained to determine if he has Lyme disease.

2. Hypertension.
- Medical Reasoning: This is well-controlled at this time.
- Patient Education and Counseling: The patient and I discussed that he is doing really well monitoring his blood pressure at home.
- Medical Treatment: Continue lisinopril 20 mg once a day. Lipid panel ordered to assess his cholesterol levels.

3. Diabetes type 2.
- Medical Reasoning: He is doing a good job managing his diabetes since his blood sugars are running in the 120s. I do not think we need to make any adjustments, but we will see what the hemoglobin A1c shows as that gives us an idea of what his blood sugars are doing on a long-term basis.
- Patient Education and Counseling: We discussed that metformin can affect kidney function; however, his kidney function was last checked 2 months ago, and it has remained within normal limits.
- Medical Treatment: Continue metformin 1000 mg twice a day. Hemoglobin A1c ordered. Basic metabolic panel ordered to assess kidney function. 

Patient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.

[patient] it's a little bit sore
[doctor] okay there is pain to palpation of the right anterior knee and i'm just gon na bend your knee up and down does that hurt at all
[patient] no no it's just more of the typical grinding that i would feel
[doctor] okay there is full range of motion of the right knee and on skin examination there is evidence of a bull's-eye rash over the right knee okay so what does that mean richard so that means that you know you do have some area of some inflammation over the over the right knee where you where you have that tick bite and you do have what we call that bull's eye rash which is what we get concerned about with with lyme disease so let's just talk a little bit about you know my assessment and my plan for you okay so for this first problem of your of your tick bite my concern is that you might have lyme disease based on the presentation of your right knee so i'm gon na go ahead and start you on doxycycline one hundred milligrams twice a day
[patient] we're gon na continue that for about three weeks i'm also gon na go ahead and send a lyme titer as well as a western blot to see if you do in fact have lyme lyme disease and we'll have to go ahead and just see how you do with this we you know i'd like to avoid intravenous antibiotics which i think we can avoid but i wanted to see how you do so
[doctor] do you have any questions about that
[patient] yeah i did n't know what those last two things or just
[doctor] yeah so so we are gon na start you on some antibiotics to help help you with this
[patient] you know possible lyme disease and i'm gon na just order some blood tests just to see exactly what's going on and then you know sometimes people need intravenous antibiotics because lyme disease can cause problems on other organs like your heart that type of thing
[doctor] if not treated appropriately and sometimes we need to give antibiotics through the iv which i'd like to avoid i think that we got this early enough that we can just treat you with some oral antibiotics okay for your second problem of your hypertension you know i think you're doing a really good job let's go ahead and continue you on the lisinopril twenty milligrams once a day and i wan na just go ahead and order a lipid panel just to make sure that everything is okay with your cholesterol how does that sound

[doctor] so it can you know your kidney function we've you know i think you've been really lucky it's been normal i checked it about two months ago and it looks pretty good it looks pretty normal but since we're doing blood work on you i can go ahead and order a a basic metabolic panel just to make sure that your kidney function is stable

MEDICAL NOTE:

CHIEF COMPLAINT

Right-sided abdominal pain

MEDICAL HISTORY

Patient reports history of kidney stones.

FAMILY HISTORY

Patient reports his father has a history of kidney stones.

MEDICATIONS

Patient reports use of Tylenol.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Gastrointestinal: Reports right-sided abdominal pain and nausea. Denies vomiting
Genitourinary: Reports dysuria and dark colored urine. Denies hematuria.

PHYSICAL EXAM

Gastrointestinal
- Examination of Abdomen: No masses or tenderness to palpation. No rebound or guarding. No peritoneal signs. Positive CVA tenderness on the right flank.

RESULTS

Previous CT scan of the abdomen ordered by the patient's PCP is reviewed and demonstrates a 0.5 cm kidney stone located in the proximal right ureter. There is no evidence of hydronephrosis.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

1. Acute nephrolithiasis.
- Medical Reasoning: The patient presents with complaints of right-sided abdominal pain. His previous CT scan was reviewed and demonstrates a 0.5 cm kidney stone located in the proximal right ureter without evidence of hydronephrosis.
- Medical Treatment: I have recommended that he push fluids in order to help facilitate urination to help pass the stone. He will be provided with a strainer to allow us to potentially test the stone if he is able to pass it. I have also prescribed oxycodone 5 mg every 6 to 8 hours as needed for pain. He can continue to alternate oxycodone with Tylenol. A basic metabolic panel, urinalysis, and urine culture will also be ordered.

INSTRUCTIONS

He will follow up in 1 to 2 weeks. If he is still having symptoms at that time, we will discuss further treatment such as lithotripsy or ureteroscopy. He is to contact me if he is having worsening symptoms over the next week.

---------------------------------------------","[doctor] hi russell how are you what's been going on
[patient] well i've been having this sharp pain on the right side of my abdomen below my ribs for the last several days
[doctor] i saw my doctor and they ordered a cat scan and said i had a kidney stone and sent me to see a urologist okay well does the pain move or or or go anywhere or does it stay right in that same spot yeah it feels like it goes to my lower abdomen in into my groin okay and is the pain constant or does it come and go it comes and goes when it comes it's it's pretty it's pretty bad i feel like i ca n't find a comfortable position okay and do you notice any any pain when you urinate or when you pee
[patient] yeah it kinda burns a little bit
[doctor] okay do you notice any blood i do n't think there is any you know frank blood but the urine looks a little dark sometimes okay and what have you taken for the pain i have taken some tylenol but it has n't really helped okay and do you have any nausea vomiting any fever chills i feel nauseated but i'm not vomiting okay is anyone in your in your family had kidney stones yes my father had them and have you had kidney stones before yeah so i i've i've had them but i've been able to pass them but this is taking a lot longer okay well i'm just gon na go ahead and do a physical examination i'm gon na be calling out some of my exam findings and i'm going to explain what what those mean when i'm done okay
[patient] okay
[doctor] okay so on physical examination of the abdomen on a abdominal exam there is no tenderness to palpation there is no evidence of any rebound or guarding there is no peritoneal signs there is positive cva tenderness on the right flank so essentially what that means russell is that you know you have some tenderness over your over your right kidney and that just means that you might have some inflammation there so i i reviewed the results of the ct scan of your abdomen that the primary care doctor ordered and it does show a . five centimeter kidney stone located in the proximal right ureter so this the ureter is the duct in which urine passes between the kidney and the bladder there's no evidence of what we call hydronephrosis this means you know swelling of the kidney which is good means that things are still able to get through so let's talk a little bit about my assessment and my plan okay so for your first problem of this acute nephrolithiasis or kidney stone i i wan na go ahead and recommend that you push fluids to help facilitate urination and peeing to help pass the stone i'm going to prescribe oxycodone five milligrams every six to eight hours as needed for pain you can continue to alternate that with some tylenol i'm going to give you a strainer that you can use to strain your urine so that we can see it see the stone when it passes and we can send it for some some tests if that happens i'm also gon na order what we call a basic metabolic panel a urinalysis and a urine culture now i wan na see you again in one to two weeks and if you're still having symptoms we'll have to discuss further treatment such as lithotripsy which is essentially a shock wave procedure in which we sedate you and use shock waves to break up the stone to help it pass we could also do what we call a ureteroscopy which is a small telescope small camera used to go up to to the urethra and bladder and up into the ureter to retrieve the stone so let's see how you do over the next week and i want you to contact me if you're having worsening symptoms okay okay sounds good thank you",911.0,Patient reports use of Tylenol.,mistral_result, The patient is currently taking Tylenol (acetaminophen) and will be prescribed Oxycodone for pain management.,1.0,Bin 1

Patient Name: andrea barnes
Age: 34.0
Gender: female
Chief Complaint: Left knee pain
Secondary Complaints: hypertension;type 2 diabetes

---------------------------------------------
MEDICAL NOTE:

CHIEF COMPLAINT

Left knee pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Andrea Barnes is a 34-year-old female who presents today for evaluation of left knee pain.

The patient has been experiencing intermittent episodes of pain and sudden instability with ambulation. Her pain is localized deep in her patella and occurs less than once daily. Due to the fleeting nature of these episodes, she has not taken medication and simply braces herself until it passes. She denies any trauma or injury, or ever hearing or feeling a pop in the knee. Her symptoms do not interfere with her daily activities and she does not use a cane.

Regarding her hypertension, it has been several days since she last checked her blood pressure at home, but it was approximately 120/70 mmHg at that time. Her current medications include amlodipine, lisinopril, and hydrochlorothiazide, all of which she takes on a regular basis.

In terms of her diabetes, her fasting morning blood glucose levels have been approximately 130 based on home monitoring. This is slightly higher than usual, even though she has been compliant with metformin and Farxiga. She does try to avoid eating late at night.

MEDICAL HISTORY

Patient reports a personal history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes.

SOCIAL HISTORY

Patient likes to travel and is planning a trip to Columbus, Georgia in the next month or so. She is part of the Lion's Club.

MEDICATIONS

Patient reports that she is taking amlodipine, lisinopril 20 mg once daily, hydrochlorothiazide, Metformin, and Farxiga.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Musculoskeletal: Reports left knee pain and instability,

VITALS

Temperature: 98.2 degrees F
Heart rate: 72 bpm
Respirations: 16
Blood pressure: 122/70 mmHg

PHYSICAL EXAM

MSK: Examination of the right knee: No ecchymosis or edema. No effusion. No pain with palpation.
Examination of the left knee: Full range of motion. Negative varus and valgus stress test.

RESULTS

X-rays were obtained and reviewed today. These reveal no evidence of fracture or bony abnormality.

ASSESSMENT

1. Left knee pain.
2. Hypertension.
3. Diabetes mellitus type 2.

PLAN

After reviewing the patients x-rays, I believe there is some arthritis in the knee. I'm going to prescribe meloxicam 15 mg once daily. We can consider physical therapy to strengthen the muscles around the area to prevent any further issues.

Her hypertension is well controlled with her current medication regimen. She can continue with lisinopril 20 mg once daily. I'm also going to order an echocardiogram for further evaluation of the murmur heard on exam.

She has been compliant with metformin as prescribed, but her blood glucose levels have been slightly elevated recently. I'm going to order a lipid panel, as well as a hemoglobin A1c to determine if any adjustments need to be made to her dose of metformin.

---------------------------------------------","[doctor] okay hi andrea well i
[patient] hello
[doctor] i understand you're you've come in with some right knee pain can you tell me about it what's going on

MEDICAL NOTE:

CHIEF COMPLAINT

Left foot pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Jean Martinez is a pleasant 27-year-old female who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of left foot pain.

The patient sustained an injury to her left foot while playing soccer yesterday. She became entangled with another player, causing the player to fall onto the patient's foot, resulting in immediate pain. After the incident, she required help to get off of the field and was unable to participate for the rest of the game. Her trainer wrapped her foot, and she has tried ice, elevation, and ibuprofen to treat her symptoms. with medication, she rates her pain as 3/10, but without medication her pain is rated as 7-8/10. There is no numbness, tingling, or other abnormal sensations associated with her pain.

Of note, the patient has sustained several injuries in the past while playing soccer, but this is her first left foot injury.

MEDICAL HISTORY

The patient reports that she has sustained several soccer injuries in the past.

SOCIAL HISTORY

The patient has been playing soccer since she was 4 or 5 years old. She is currently playing in a local league.

MEDICATIONS

The patient reports that she has been taking ibuprofen.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Musculoskeletal: Reports left foot pain.
Neurological: Denies left foot numbness or tingling.

VITALS

Blood pressure: 118/72 mmHg
Heart rate: 58 bpm
Respiratory rate: 14
Temperature: Afebrile
Oxygen saturation: 99% on room air

PHYSICAL EXAM

CV: Regular rate and rhythm without clicks, rubs, or murmurs. No ectopic beats noted on auscultation of the heart. Brisk capillary refill, less than 3 seconds. Dorsalis pedis pulse is intact and strong.
RESPIRATORY: Lungs are clear and equal bilaterally.
NEURO: Motor and sensation in the left foot are intact to light touch.
MSK: Examination of the left foot: Ecchymosis on the plantar and dorsal aspects of the foot. Associated swelling. Tenderness to palpation of the midfoot. Positive piano key test.

RESULTS

X-ray images of the left foot were obtained and reviewed today. These reveal subtle dorsal displacement of the base of the 2nd metatarsal with a 3 mm separation of the 1st and 2nd metatarsal bases. There is presence of a bony fragment in the Lisfranc joint space.

ASSESSMENT

Lisfranc fracture, left foot.

PLAN

I explained the nature of her injury in detail. Based on her exam and x-ray findings, she will most likely require surgery of the left foot, but I want to order an MRI to assess for any ligamentous injuries. We discussed the procedure and postoperative expectations, such as recovery time and restrictions, at length. We also discussed the complications associated with deferring surgical intervention including poor bone and ligament healing, pes planus deformation, and a high likelihood of developing arthritis in the foot. She will be unable to participate for the remainder of the soccer season, but should be able to play next season.

INSTRUCTIONS

We will see the patient on Monday, for surgery.

---------------------------------------------","[doctor] hey jean how're you doing today
[patient] i'm doing alright aside from this foot pain that i have
[doctor] so i see here that you looks like you hurt your left foot here where you were playing soccer can you tell me a little bit more about what happened
[patient] yeah so yeah i was playing in a soccer game yesterday and i was trying to steal the ball from another player and she ended up falling directly onto my right foot and i do n't know i i mean i was trying to get around her and my body ended up twisting around her and then i accidentally felt a pain in my foot
[doctor] okay so have you ever hurt your left foot before
[patient] no i've had a lot of injuries in soccer but never injured this foot
[doctor] okay and then so after the fall and the entanglement with the other player were you able to continue playing
[patient] no i had to stop playing right away and actually being helped off the field
[doctor] wow okay and what have you been doing for the the pain since then
[patient] so i've been keeping it elevated icing it the trainer wrapped it yesterday and taking ibuprofen as well
[doctor] okay alright so without any ibuprofen can you tell me what your pain level is
[patient] without ibuprofen i would say my pain is a three
[doctor] okay and then with your ibuprofen can you tell me what your pain level is
[patient] like a seven eight
[doctor] okay so how long have you been playing soccer
[patient] really since i was like four five i've been playing a long time
[doctor] well that's cool yeah we our our youngest daughter she is almost sixteen and she plays the inner marrial soccer league they are down at the rex center did is that where you started playing or did you guys did you start playing somewhere else
[patient] yeah just like this local town leak i started playing that way and then played all throughout school
[doctor] that's
[patient] high school teams
[doctor] that's awesome so just out of curiosity with the left foot have you experienced anything like numbness or tingling or or any strange sensation
[patient] no i have not
[doctor] okay now if it's okay with you i would like to do a quick physical exam i reviewed your vitals and everything looks good blood pressure was one eighteen over seventy two heart rate was fifty eight respiratory rate was fourteen you are afebrile and you had an o2 saturation of ninety nine percent on room air on your heart exam your regular of rate and rhythm do n't appreciate any clicks rubs or murmurs no ectopic beats noted there on auscultation listening to your lungs lungs are clear and equal bilaterally so you're moving good air i'd like to do a focused foot exam on your left foot so i do see some bruising on the bottom of your foot and on the top of your foot as well now there is associated swelling and i do appreciate tenderness to palpation of your midfoot and you are positive for the piano key test on a neurovascular exam of your left foot you have a brisk capillary refill of less than three seconds dorsalis pedis pulse is intact and strong and you do have motor and sensation that it's intact to light touch now i would like to do a review of the diagnostic imaging that you had before you came in so i do notice a subtle dorsal displacement of the base of the second metatarsal with a three millimeter separation of the first and second metatarsal bases and the presence of a bony fragment in the lisfranc joint space so lem me talk to you a little bit about my assessment and plan now for for the first concern of right foot pain your right foot pain is due to a lisfranc fracture which is a fracture to one of your second metatarsal bones at the top of your foot where the metatarsals meet your cuboids now there are ligaments at the top of your foot so i'm gon na be ordering an mri to assess for injury to any of these ligaments now based on your exam and from what i'm seeing on your x-ray you're most likely going to need surgery of that foot now the surgery will place the bones back in their proper position and using plates and screws will hold them there while they heal and this is gon na allow those bones and ligaments to heal properly it is a day surgery and you will be able to go home the same day and then i'm going to have you follow up with me here in the clinic you'll be in a cast and you will need to use crutches and you will not be able to use that left foot for about six to eight weeks now after that six to eight weeks you will gradually start walking on your foot based on how you tolerate it and we'll see how you do at that point so i do believe you're gon na need surgery i i'm recommending this because there are significant complications to your foot if we do not do this poor bone and ligament healing can lead to losing the arch of your foot and you're becoming flat-footed you also have a high likelihood of developing arthritis in that foot so what i'm gon na do unfortunately you'll be out the rest of the season but we are gon na get you fixed up and ready for next season if you're okay with all of this i'm gon na have the nurse come in and get you started on your paperwork and then i will see you on monday morning and we will get your foot taken care of

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Dylan Bennett is a pleasant 53-year-old male who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of bilateral elbow pain, right worse than left.

The patient has been experiencing bilateral elbow pain, right worse than left, for approximately 1.5 years. His pain is localized to the medial aspect of his elbows and is described as being extremely sore, worse with increased use of his upper extremities. Of note, he utilizes heavy weights for strength training and was very active in sports when he was younger, primarily playing basketball, baseball, and football, but he denies having any pain at that time. Applying ice to the area has not been helpful, but he does use ibuprofen 800 mg 3 times daily.

SOCIAL HISTORY

The patient reports that utilizes heavy weights for strength training. He was also very active in sports when he was younger, primarily playing basketball, baseball, and football.

He is expecting a newborn baby in the near future.

MEDICATIONS

The patient reports that he has been taking ibuprofen 800 mg 3 times daily.

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, we had a lengthy discussion in regards to his current symptoms. I want to get an MRI of the bilateral elbows for further evaluation. We discussed the possibility of performing a whole blood transfusion to encourage healing, and the patient is already familiar with this procedure.

[patient] yes
[doctor] okay so pain on the medial side with palpation
[patient] yes
[doctor] alright how about the outside
[patient] no
[doctor] no pain with palpation outside of the elbow you have do you have normal sensation in your fingers
[patient] i think so
[doctor] yeah
[patient] yeah
[doctor] okay great
[patient] good to go
[doctor] sensation is normal to the touch
[patient] yes
[doctor] pulses equal in all extremities how about the left elbow same thing if i bend it this way does that hurt
[patient] not as much
[doctor] how about this way
[patient] not as much
[doctor] alright so little bit of pain on flexion and extension little bit of limited range of motion on extension of the arm how about if you twist like you're opening a door
[patient] yes
[doctor] okay so some pain with torsion and twisting supination what about pronation
[patient] no
[doctor] no pain with pronation on the right side
[patient] mm-hmm
[doctor] same thing on the left
[patient] yes
[doctor] pain with supination no pain with pronation
[patient] correct
[doctor] alright so dylan it took some x-rays coming in looks like you do n't have any any fractures or any bony misalignment which i expect with this kind of injury i do think that what you have is medial epicondylitis which is
[patient] is that golfer's elbow
[doctor] yes same thing have you been golfing a lot
[patient] well not in the past year and a half i've had this for a long time
[doctor] okay also known as pictures elbow
[patient] well i have n't been pitching either
[doctor] hmmm well in any case what i'm gon na have to do is i'm gon na send you up for mri to take another look at this
[patient] mm-hmm
[doctor] that will be our next step so we'll get you scheduled for the mri probably get you in pretty quick here since we're a private practice
[patient] thank god
[doctor] yeah and once you get the mri i'll know a little bit more what i'd like to do is something called a whole blood transfusion have you heard of that before
[patient] no please tell me remind me
[doctor] yeah it should help with the healing of your elbow it's just a procedure we'll stick a needle in your elbow
[patient] you do a stick needle in my elbow
[doctor] mm-hmm and help with some of the healing of your elbow
[patient] so it's kinda like dry needling then
[doctor] no
[patient] not at all
[doctor] what is it
[patient] is it is that that thing where like you take the blood out of like say my my thigh
[doctor] mm-hmm
[patient] and then you literally inject it into my tendon
[doctor] yes
[patient] that it activates the healing
[doctor] yeah that's exactly what it is
[patient] interesting cool
[doctor] yeah
[patient] maybe i have heard about that
[doctor] we've we've had some really good responses from other patients on it so hopefully i mean that should be a good solution for you since you've been having issues with this
[patient] i'm excited
[doctor] yeah and we can hopefully get you scheduled for that in the next couple of weeks it's not not a major procedure and you should heal in the next two weeks so that wo n't be a problem especially considering that you're expecting a newborn soon we want to make sure you're all healed for that
[patient] wow i did n't even say that
[doctor] i read it in your chart

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

1. Congestive heart failure.
- Medical Reasoning: This appears to have been caused by dietary indiscretion and uncontrolled hypertension.
- Patient Education and Counseling: I encouraged the patient to continue making dietary modifications, including limiting her sodium intake.

I also advised her to monitor her weight daily and contact me if she gains 3 pounds in 2 days.
- Medical Treatment: Continue with Bumex 2 mg once daily. Referral placed for consult with a nutritionist for education and recommendations regarding her diet.

2. Hypertension.
- Medical Reasoning: This has been poorly controlled due to inconsistent compliance with medication and dietary indiscretion.
- Patient Education and Counseling: We discussed dietary modifications as noted above.
- Medical Treatment: She can continue on Cozaar 100 mg daily and Norvasc 5 mg once daily. Renal artery ultrasound ordered to rule out any issues such as renal artery stenosis.

[doctor] goodness
[patient] yes that's not very pleasant at all

[patient] okay i'll i'll give that a try anything that will help
[doctor] yeah okay well that's good to hear so now have you bought a blood pressure cuff to have at home now
[patient] yes i already had one but i very failed if i ever used it

[patient] i'll i'll try to use it everyday now
[doctor] okay and you might even just keep a log of what your blood pressures are and when it's up think about you know what you've eaten if you've done something different because that may help you to figure out what you need to cut back on or how you might need to change your your eating habits a little bit so

Gender: female 
Chief Complaint: follow-up bilateral breast cysts
Secondary Complaints: anxiety; itchiness

---------------------------------------------
MEDICAL NOTE:

CHIEF COMPLAINT

Follow-up bilateral breast cysts.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Donna Torres is a 40-year-old female who presents for follow-up surveillance of bilateral breast cysts.

The patient reports continual presence of “lumps” in bilateral breasts with some soreness. She is being seen today for surveillance of the cysts. The patient is taking progesterone, which was initially prescribed to support normalization of menstruation, which was effective. She is also still using vaginal cream one time per week which has improved symptoms of itching and discomfort.

Her last pap smear was in 2019, with negative/negative results. She did have an abnormal pap smear in 2009, which resulted in repeat pap smears per 6 months until her results normalized.

Mrs. Torres experienced increased anxiety in 11/2021 and 12/2021, stating “it was brutal” and felt she could not manage her symptoms and sought treatment. Dr. Brown started the patient on Buspar, which has successfully controlled her anxiety. The patient relates her anxiety to work related stress and possibly aging. Her work involves supporting Covid evaluation centers and clinics. She confirms receiving both Covid vaccinations. Initially, she was experiencing spikes in anxiety prior to menstruation, but her anxiety then became more random with an unclear cause. To note, the patient was started on Singulair, which the patient was told could also cause anxiety.

The patient discontinued Camila birth control, which did result in a significant increase in appetite. This has resolved and she reports she has lost weight in the past 6 months.

---------------------------------------------","[doctor] donna torres , date of birth , 08/01/1980 .
[doctor] hi donna ! how are you ?
[patient] i'm good . how about you ?
[doctor] i'm doing well , thank you . and so , i saw that dr. brown put you on buspar . have you been on that before ?
[patient] no , that's new .
[doctor] okay . how is it working for you ?
[patient] my anxiety is going good now , thankfully . i'm serious , it was brutal in november and december . finally , i was like , "" i can not do this . "" i have no idea why it happened . dr. ward did put me on singulair , and she did say we need to be careful because singulair can cause anxiety . so i'm not sure if that was the issue or what .
[doctor] mm . okay .
[patient] and it would , um , start usually during the day , at work .
[doctor] i see .
[patient] i mean , i'm fine now .
[doctor] well , that's good , that things have settled . i do wonder if some of what you are dealing with is hormonal , and that's why i was asking . 'cause you were on the progesterone , and i feel like you were having some irritability back then too .
[patient] i did .
[doctor] and that was before we started the progesterone .
[patient] yes .
[doctor] so i know we started it for regulating your periods , but perhaps it helped with this also .
[patient] yeah . and before , in november and december , i noticed that the week before my period , my anxiety would go through the roof . which then , i knew my period was coming . then it turned into my anxiety spiking just at random times .
[doctor] hmm , okay .
[patient] and it seemed like it was for no reason .
[doctor] but november and december you were on the progesterone at that time .
[patient] yes .
[doctor] all right . so not really a link there , all right .
[patient] yeah , i do n't know .
[doctor] yeah , i do n't know either . um , sometimes with the aging process , that can happen too .
[patient] i figured maybe that's what it was .
[doctor] and we did go through the golive in november and december , so that can be pretty stressful also .
[patient] yeah , and at work , that's when i first started to lead the process of delivering the results to patients with covid . in the beginning of the whole pandemic , patients would have to wait nine days before they'd get their results . and then we opened the evaluation centers and the covid clinic . so i think it just took a toll on me .
[doctor] yeah , i can absolutely see that .
[patient] yeah , and then i was feeling selfish because i was n't even on the front lines . i mean , i was supporting people , sure , but i was n't in the icu . so i felt selfish and guilty . i mean , hands down , the physicians and nurses were in the thick of it and there i was , having anxiety . and it felt ridiculous .
[doctor] well , honestly , you feel how you feel and what you were doing was n't easy as well , so ... but let's see . i need to just put this dax back to work . all right , so no other issues whatsoever ?
[patient] no .
[doctor] have you lost weight ?
[patient] no , but i stopped taking the camila birth control . my hunger level was at a new high . i mean , i was eating constantly . i felt like , "" what is going on ? ""
[doctor] all right .
[patient] and now i am feeling better .
[doctor] okay , that's good . and your masked face , though , it does look thinner .
[patient] well , the past six months i have lost some weight .
[doctor] okay , good . um , anything else going on ?
[patient] no .
[doctor] all right . so your pap was in 2019 . i do n't think that we need to repeat that because it was negative/negative . um , have you ever had an abnormal pap ?
[patient] not with you , but i did around 2009 , and then i had to be seen every six months for a while . and then i had a normal pap .
[doctor] all right , well , let's just repeat it then .
[patient] yeah , that's fine with me , to be safe .
[doctor] okay . i know it sounds superstitious , but i feel like with all the immunocompromising , the pressure , the stress that people's bodies have been under , and the potential for getting covid or the vaccine ... i have actually seen some , um , an increase in abnormal paps in people who have been fine for a while . so that's why i figure let's just check .
[patient] okay . i fight the vaccine fight every day at home because my husband is n't ready to get it . same with my daughter . she shares the same worries as her dad in how it'll impact her when she gets older .
[doctor] have you had the vaccine ?
[patient] yes , i have . and so has my son . he , um , has had his first already .
[doctor] okay . well , you know , you can only do what you can do .
[patient] yeah , i agree .
[doctor] all right . well , let's complete your exam .
[patient] all right .
[doctor] so let's take a deep breath . and again . all right , you can breathe normally . all right , and take one more deep breath . okay , now i'm gon na touch your neck . go ahead and swallow . perfect . and just place your hand above your head . okay , i do feel some little bumps .
[patient] yeah , but they're not as big as they were .
[doctor] mm-hmm . okay , in this breast it does feel a little bit denser . does it hurt at all ?
[patient] it does , where your left hand just was .
[doctor] okay , right here ?
[patient] yeah , down here . but whenever i breastfed , it was always sore there too . i had a clog and something else . the lumps do feel smaller , but they are still there , unfortunately .
[doctor] yeah , they are . uh , well now i do n't know , because if it was the progesterone , they would've gone away .
[patient] yeah .
[doctor] all right , well just let your knees just op- relax and open . how's the itching or discomfort ? are you still using the cream ?
[patient] yes , and i actually need to get that refilled for the first time ever .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] uh , but yeah , i use it once a week and it does help .
[doctor] okay , great . all right , looks good .
[patient] good .
[doctor] you can go ahead and sit up .
[patient] thank you .
[doctor] all right , so typically the lumps would often just shrink up pretty quickly after you've had one or two cycles , and you've had two cycles so far . so i think let's just keep monitoring them for now .
[patient] okay . and what could that mean ?
[doctor] well , so just like people have an increased risk of breast cancer , there's also an increased risk for breast issues . you know what i mean ? so for example , cysts and lumps and fibroadenomas , those are all benign things . they're annoying and require some workup , but they're all benign .
[patient] and i'm- i'm just worried because i'm almost 40 and my mom was almost 45 when she was diagnosed with breast cancer . so i mean , i know there's nothing i can do about it , but it's just i feel like , uh , we had it under control and now it is n't .
[doctor] well , i would n't say that . i mean , i feel like we're at a point where we have a good cadence for you having surveillance on things , and i think you are more aware of your breasts than ever before , and things actually have n't changed .
[patient] yeah .
[doctor] so those are all good things .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] because , um , if it was cancer , we'd actually , we would see some change .
[patient] we would ? okay , thank you for explaining that .
[doctor] yeah . so i know it's annoying and distressing , but i think that's where we're at . it's annoying that you have the breast issue , and it's annoying that we have to follow them .
[patient] yeah , i agree there .
[doctor] um , but the only extra that i could po- , uh , potentially do , is we could get a breast specialist on the team and have you start to follow with them . and one of the advantages there is that they sometimes will do an ultrasound as an extension of their physical exam , in the office , to check out it- check it out on their own . uh , they also have a lot more experience and more willingness to sometimes perform procedures earlier , if they think it needs , um , if they think it needs to be done . and i think they tend to be much quicker than , you know , like radiology as to biopsy it .
[patient] okay . i'll do whatever you think i should .
[doctor] all right . well , i think since you're feeling worried , let's go ahead and we can get them on board . i'll send out a referral and they will call you within the next couple of business days to schedule .
[patient] okay , i think that sounds great .
[doctor] all right . i do too . all right , well any questions or anything else we can discuss today ?
[patient] no , i think i'm all set .
[doctor] all right , good . all right , well have a good rest of your day and just give us a call if you need anything else .
[patient] all right , thank you . you have a good day too .

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

1. Asthma.
- Medical Reasoning: The patient has experienced an increased need to use her albuterol inhaler. She is not currently utilizing a daily medication. At this time, we will try a daily medication since it looks like she might be having some allergies.
- Patient Education and Counseling: I explained the side effects of albuterol to the patient. We also discussed Singulair and that she should start to see a difference in her breathing within approximately 1 month.
- Medical Treatment: We will start her on a daily asthma medication. She can continue to use the albuterol inhaler. We will start her on Singulair in about a month.

2. Mood.
- Medical Reasoning: The patient reports being under a lot of stress with school. I believe this may be attributing to her mood.
- Medical Treatment: I would like for the patient to be seen by a therapist. She will also complete our screening questionnaire.

Patient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.

INSTRUCTIONS

The patient will follow up in 6 weeks for recheck.

---------------------------------------------","[doctor] okay
[patient] good morning
[doctor] good morning thanks doctor doctor cooper i'm i'm you know i'm a little i'm sad to be in here but you know thanks for taking me in i appreciate it
[patient] sure absolutely what can i help you with today
[doctor] so you know i've been dealing with my asthma and like i tried to join sports but it's really kind of it's getting hard you know and i i i just wonder if there's something that can be done because i really do like playing water polo
[patient] but i'm having difficulty breathing sometimes i've had to like you know stop matches and sit on the side just to kind of like catch my breath and use my inhaler so i was wondering if there was something we could do about it
[doctor] and then like i'm kind of a little bit worried i think my mood is getting a little a little worrisome and i i wanted to explore like what my options were
[patient] okay let's talk about the asthma first so what inhaler are you using now
[doctor] i have an albuterol inhaler
[patient] okay and when when you're having trouble it's usually just around sports that is it keeping you up at night
[doctor] so i do n't really like wake up at night a lot typically like it's sports like you know if i'm doing anything like crazy aerobic or like running or anything i do notice that if any if i'm around smoke i do start coughing a little bit but most of the time it's sports
[patient] okay and can you describe a little bit for me what happens
[doctor] i start to yeah no so i start to feel like there is like some phlegm building up in my in my throat and i start coughing like my chest gets tight i start wheezing and i just have to sit down or else i'm gon na get like lightheaded too
[patient] okay and then when you use your inhaler
[doctor] mm-hmm
[patient] does it does it alleviate the problem
[doctor] so yeah it helps with that like phlegm feeling you know but i still i still have to sit down you know and like breathe and then the thing that i hate about that inhaler is i start getting like shaky is that supposed to be happening
[patient] yes that is unfortunately normal and a side effect with the inhaler
[doctor] okay
[patient] so you use you're using two puffs of the inhaler
[doctor] mm-hmm
[patient] for the symptoms
[doctor] yes
[patient] and then you sit down and does it does it get better within about fifteen minutes or so
[doctor] yeah yeah it does but you know i had to like step out of the the pool to make that happen i'm hoping that there is something else we can do okay have you ever taken any daily medications for your asthma an inhaler or singulair or anything like that no i i just use my inhaler whenever i have an attack
[patient] okay so that's something we might wan na consider but how often is it happening
[doctor] pretty much every time i do any kind of aerobic workout
[patient] okay and outside of physical activity you're not having any problems
[doctor] yeah there's that part where like if i'm around somebody who has been smoking a lot or is currently smoking but i usually just step away i do n't even like to be around them you know that makes sense
[patient] alright well we will look at that tell me about the mood issues you are having
[doctor] yeah so one of the reasons i got into like trying to get into sports is like i feel like you know you you feel a lot more energized and a lot you know happier but like lately i've just been kinda stressed out you know like i have i have like sats that i need to study for i've got like all these ap classes you know there's just it i feel like there's a lot of pressure and you know like i get it but there are times where i'm just like really down and i i do n't really know what else i can do
[patient] okay that makes sense any any difficulty with focusing or you're having difficulty retaining information or is it more feeling sad not having motivation
[doctor] so i think it's like a lot of sadness a lot of like you know i do n't really i kinda feel like you know i do n't really like want to do anything you know my friends will go out and i'll just be like i'd rather be at home i am really tired a lot too
[patient] okay alright well let me let me go ahead and check you out
[doctor] mm-hmm
[patient] and then we can talk a little bit more
[doctor] okay
[patient] i'm gon na take a listen to your heart and lungs
[doctor] mm-hmm
[patient] and everything sounds good
[doctor] let me take a look at your eyes
[patient] mm-hmm and in your ears everything looks okay have you had any problems with allergies you have seasonal allergies or anything like that
[doctor] yeah i think so yeah
[patient] i do see just a little bit of fluid in the ears
[doctor] mm-hmm
[patient] and i'm gon na look in your mouth too
[doctor] okay
[patient] and throat looks fine no tonsils
[doctor] mm-hmm
[patient] lem me go ahead and have you lay back on the table and i'll take a listen to your stomach
[doctor] okay
[patient] everything sounds okay i'm gon na feel around just to make sure everything feels normal
[doctor] mm-hmm
[patient] everything feels fine and i'm gon na check reflexes and they're all normal
[doctor] awesome
[patient] it's really hard to do with actual patient so in terms of the asthma i think we could try a daily medication since it looks like you might be having a little bit of allergies maybe we can try some singulair
[doctor] mm-hmm
[patient] and start with that once you are on that daily and you can continue to use the albuterol inhaler those side effects unfortunately you're right it's it's just one of the expected side effects with an albuterol inhaler i would recommend just what you're doing just sit down for a little bit after you take it
[doctor] and we will get you started on the singulair probably within about a month you should see a difference so i will have you come back in about six weeks and follow up and see how you're doing with that
[patient] in terms of the mood is this new for you
[doctor] yeah i think so like when i started this year
[patient] and it sounds like related to school expectations and the stress with saps and all of that
[doctor] yeah
[patient] okay let's consider having you start seeing a therapist i think that would be a good place to start
[doctor] mm-hmm
[patient] and we will do some screening questionnaires and and then follow up in a couple weeks on that too
[doctor] okay alright sounds like a plan okay
[patient] thank you",823.2666666666667,"Patient reports using an albuterol inhaler, 2 puffs as needed.",mistral_result," The patient is currently using an albuterol inhaler for their asthma symptoms. They have not been prescribed any daily medications for their asthma at this time. However, the doctor plans to start them on Singulair for asthma management and allergy relief within a month.

[patient] yeah i take my medicine okay my diet is alright you know i could be fifteen pounds lighter that would be alright but
[doctor] sure
[patient] i i i think the sugar has been okay
[doctor] okay we checked your hemoglobin a1c last time i'm looking at your records in epic and it showed that it was you know seven . one so it's it's it's good but it could be better any you know we talked about it controlling your diet or improving your diet and trying to have a balanced meal and not eating some of these sweets and high sugar items how is that going i know you had talked about your wife being a great cook and making cookies and that's hard to stay away from obviously how are things going with that
[patient] yeah she still makes cookies and i still eat them but you know we are trying to trying to do better trying to stay away from more of those carbs and focus on you know less carby less sweet stuff
[doctor] okay alright yeah that's always a struggle i certainly understand but you know really important with your diabetes just to prevent some of the complications like kidney failure and eye problems and just keep your sugar under balance so i'll order another hemoglobin a1c today we'll check that again today and and you know just reemphasizing the controlling your diet and exercise is super important and then we'll have those results back we'll we'll see if we need to make any modifications okay
[patient] okay
[doctor] for your high blood pressure your blood pressure in the clinic looks pretty good it's about one twenty over seventy right now we have you on norvasc five milligrams once a day how are things going with that are you are you checking that periodically or any issues with that at all
[patient] yeah i guess i check it maybe once a week or two or three times a month and it it the vast majority of the time when i check it it's good usually either that one twenty to one thirty over seventy to eighty range i i think the blood pressure's okay
[doctor] okay
[patient] i have n't had any real problems there i i have had some some swelling in my ankles though
[doctor] okay is that new or is that been going on for a while
[patient] well it it started maybe i do n't know a month or two after i started the norvasc

Gender: female 
Chief Complaint: hypothyroidism 
Secondary Complaints: weight loss; acne

MEDICAL NOTE:

CHIEF COMPLAINT

Hypothyroidism.
Abnormal liver enzymes.
Abnormal weight gain.
Acne vulgaris.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Christine Hernandez is a 39-year-old female who presents today for evaluation and management of abnormal liver enzymes and hypothyroidism.

When the patient was last seen, her thyroid medicine was changed to Unithroid, but due to the cost of $75, she has not yet started the new medicine and continues taking her previous thyroid medicine. She denies utilizing the coupon that was previously recommended for the Unithroid. Similarly, the patient was prescribed Epiduo for her acne vulgaris, which she did not fill due to the cost of $100. She tried filling both prescriptions at Walmart.

Mrs. Hernandez still presents with abnormal weight gain. She questioned if her oral contraceptive Microgestin, which was discontinued, could have been the cause. Additional symptoms included acne, hirsutism. She is attempting to modify her intake and plans to resume her gym membership in July as she will be on vacation. She inquired about the impact on weight loss of chromium, CLA, and amino acids.

The patient confirmed that she is taking her high dose Vitamin D as prescribed. She does suffer from constipation and she treats with MiraLAX.

She denies previous treatment for her acne vulgaris. She denies ever using clindamycin topical antibiotic. She reports having sensitive skin, developing rashes with various skin products.

PAST HISTORY

Medical
Hypothyroidism.
Acne Vulgaris.
Vitamin D deficiency.
Abnormal weight gain.
Hirsutism.
Constipation.

CURRENT MEDICATIONS

Benzoyl Peroxide.
Clindamycin Gel applied topically.
Vitamin D 2000 IU daily.
Unithroid.
MiraLAX.

ALLERGIES

No known allergies.

RESULTS

Dexamethasone Suppression Test: Normal.

Salivary Cortisol Tests: 2 out of 3 were normal. Not consistent with Cushing’s Syndrome.

Hepatic Function Panel: ALT 128.
Lipid Panel: Total cholesterol 222 mg/dL, HDL 44 mg/dL, LDL 153 mg/dL, non-HDL 178 mg/dL.

FAI: Normal.

ASSESSMENT

• Hypothyroidism.
• Abnormal liver enzymes.
• Abnormal weight gain.
• Acne vulgaris
• Vitamin D deficiency.
• Hirsutism

PLAN

Hypothyroidism
The patient will again attempt to initiate Unithroid. I have printed out the prescription and a discount card, which should result in a reduced price. She will contact my office if she encounters additional issues.

Abnormal liver enzymes
We have seen improvement since the discontinuation of Microgestin. I recommended the spermicide Phexxi for alternative birth control. The patient will also continue working on weight loss, which should additionally improve her liver enzymes.

Abnormal weight gain
Cushing’s Syndrome has been ruled out. I reviewed the weight loss study with the patient, she will call within a month if she is interested in participating. I advised her to follow a low carbohydrate, low cholesterol, abstain from alcohol, and reduce fatty foods diet.

Acne vulgaris
Epiduo was not covered and too expensive. The patient will try benzoyl peroxide and Clindamycin separately to see if the price improves.

Vitamin D deficiency
The patient will complete the high dose vitamin D and then should start vitamin D 2000 IU per day to maintain her levels.

Hirsutism
Her androgen levels were normal.

INSTRUCTIONS

She will repeat all labs prior to her next visit.","[doctor] next patient is christine hernandez , uh , date of birth is january 13th , 1982 .
[doctor] hey , miss christine , how are you doing today ?
[patient] i'm good , thanks . how are you ?
[doctor] i'm pretty good . so it looks like you've completed the covid vaccine , that's great .
[patient] yes , i did .
[doctor] anything new since your last visit ?
[patient] no , i did all the tests that you had recommended me to take . i have n't been able to take the thyroid medicine , the one that you prescribed , as i'm still taking my old one . um , the price was a little high on the new one .
[doctor] okay , so did ... did you try the coupon that i gave you ?
[patient] i did not try the coupon , uh , there was a charge of $ 75 .
[doctor] okay , well , next time that ... that coupon should help , and it should only be about $ 3 .
[patient] okay , um ... i do n't have it , do you happen to have another one you can give me ?
[doctor] yep , right here .
[patient] wonderful , thank you so much , and ... and then the gel , they are charging me $ 100 for it . so , i do n't know if this is because it's a ... it's wal-mart , or if i should try somewhere else , or ... maybe you know how or where i can get it cheaper .
[doctor] yeah , let's try something else , um ... sometimes it can be cheaper if we just prescribe you the individual ingredients of a medication , rather than the , the combined medication itself .
[patient] that would be great .
[doctor] so , that's clindamycin gel and benzoyl peroxide , uh , maybe by doing them separately , they could be a lot cheaper . so , that we can do . the unithroid , with the discount code , should only be about $ 9 for 90 days .
[patient] okay , that would be great . yeah , they were charging me $ 75 , and i just could n't pay that .
[doctor] maybe we'll try different pharmacy , as well .
[patient] okay . so , do you think that my weight gain could have been the birth control that i was taking before that caused it ?
[doctor] maybe . i do n't really see an endocrine cause for it , at least , so i would need to see the , the hyperandrogynism or high testosterone . or , a high dhea , to cause acne , or hair growth , or any of that stuff . but , the numbers are n't showing up out of range .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] i really do n't see any endocrine cause for it , like i said . your growth hormone was fine , but we definitely want to and need to treat it . um , i do n't know if we talked about maybe a little weight loss study .
[patient] you mentioned the weight loss study , and you mentioned that i have some meal plans , um , that you had given me . i still have those , too .
[doctor] have you tried to make any changes in the diet since the last time we spoke ?
[patient] i've been trying to get better . i will start back at the gym in july , because of my contract , i had to put a hold on it until then .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] so , i do want to start doing that . i will be a little freer since , um , i'll be on vacation after july 8th .
[doctor] okay , good .
[patient] and then my cousin was telling me to ask you about cla , because it's supposed to help your metabolism . is that okay to take ?
[doctor] um , i'm not sure . what is c , cla ?
[patient] i'm not sure what it is , either .
[doctor] okay , well , i'm unfamiliar with it , so ...
[patient] okay . i also have a coworker who has a thyroid issue too , and she suggested to try chromium for weight loss .
[doctor] so , that likely will not help too much . you can try either , if you really want to , but then ... it will not accept you into the weight loss study if you try those two .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] chromium is just a supplement and it wo n't help that much .
[patient] it wo n't , okay , thank you .
[doctor] it wo n't hurt ... okay , i should n't say that it wo n't hurt , but , it also wo n't help that much . so , it's up to you .
[patient] okay . and so , my cousin also suggested amino acids , and that i might find them in certain foods , i guess , for my workout .
[doctor] yeah . amino acids are fine , they wo n't , wo n't really help with weight loss either , but it might help , uh , you replenish , and just kind of , feel hydrated .
[patient] okay . are they proteins ? um , my cousin said she had lost some weight , and has been working out every day , but she does n't work , so ... i do n't know .
[doctor] yes , amino acids are what make up the protein , which is in any food you eat , with any protein . so , meats , dairy , nuts , any of that sort of thing .
[patient] okay , thank you . got it .
[doctor] all right . um , are you allergic to any medications ?
[patient] no , not that i know of .
[doctor] okay . is your s- skin pretty sensitive ?
[patient] yes .
[doctor] all right .
[patient] um , yeah , my size , i will start getting rashes , with different products .
[doctor] and have you ever tried clindamycin topical , as an antibiotic for your acne ?
[patient] no , i've never tried anything for it .
[doctor] okay . we might give you some of that .
[patient] okay . and i also want to mention that my feet do swell up a lot .
[doctor] okay . i'm ... let me take a look at that for just a moment . um , any constipation ?
[patient] yes , i also do have that problem .
[doctor] all right . mira- miralax will definitely help with that .
[patient] okay , yes , my doctor did also recommend that .
[doctor] great . all right , let's do an exam real quick . please have a seat on this table and i'll listen to your lungs and heart .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] all right , deep breath . all right , again .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] all right , sounds good .
[patient] great .
[doctor] let me take a look at your feet and ankles .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] all right , they look okay right now , certainly let your doctor know about this if it gets any worse or reoccurs .
[patient] okay , i will do that .
[doctor] now , let's go over your lab work . so , when you took that pill , the dexamethasone test , you passed , which means you do n't have cushing's syndrome . on that test , at least . the salivary cortisol , though , unless you did one wrong ... two of them were completely normal and one was abnormal , so , we might need to repeat that in the future .
[patient] okay , that's okay .
[doctor] all right , so , your cholesterol was quite high . the total cholesterol was 222 . the good cholesterol was about 44 . the bad was 153 , and it should be less than 100 . the non-hdl was about 178 , and it should be less than 130 . the good cholesterol should be over 50 , and it was 44 . so , your screen for diabetes is ... was fine . you do have a vitamin d deficiency , and , i do n't know if we started the vitamin d yet , or not .
[patient] yes , we did . i- i do need to take one today , though .
[doctor] okay . so , i also checked a lot of other pituitary hormones , iron levels ... everything else seemed to be pretty good , and in decent range .
[patient] okay , that sounds great . so , i wanted to also show you my liver enzymes , um , because i have n't come back since then ... but i was also happy , because one of them was back to normal .
[doctor] okay , great . let's see them .
[patient] okay . so , the one that's 30 , that was almost 200 not so long ago .
[doctor] yeah , your alt was about 128 .
[patient] okay , and , and back in october was 254 .
[doctor] yeah , this is much better .
[patient] okay , great . and then it dropped in january , and then it dropped a little more in march , since i stopped taking the medicine in december .
[doctor] okay , that's good . so ... i'm proud of you with the course of your labs , so before i forget , i'm going to , uh , just put your labs into the computer today , and i wo n't be checking your vitamin d level for some time .
[patient] okay . so , with the thyroid , and the low vitamin d , does that always happen together ?
[doctor] um , i do have a lot of people that have thyroid , thyroid issues and they have vitamin d deficiency .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] this is what i'm , um , i'm going to do . i'm going to put , print out your prescriptions , so you can shop around at the pharmacies and see if you can find better prices .
[patient] okay , that way i can go ask them and try cvs .
[doctor] yeah , that sounds like a plan .
[patient] okay , good . so , the weight loss study that you mentioned , when does that start ? or , how does that work ?
[doctor] so , we are about to start , as we just got approval last week , and we are just waiting on our paperwork so we can get started .
[patient] okay , and what's involved with that ?
[doctor] so , it'll involve you receiving a medication which has been used for diabetes treatment , and it works mostly in the gut on satiety , or satiety hormones . um , the most common side effects are going to be nausea , vomiting , diarrhea and constipation . they are s- uh , six arms , to the study . one is a placebo , the other ones are a , various as ... various dosages of the medication , excuse me . um , you would receive an injection once a week . also , keep in mind that most of the weight loss medications are not covered by insurance .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] so , it's a way of getting them , but , the odds of getting one of the arms with the medication that are in your favor , right , might be only one out of five of our hundred patients that we have on the list for the study that will receive the placebo .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] does that make sense ?
[patient] yes , it does .
[doctor] so , we do expect pretty big weight loss , because of what we learn in diabetes study . so , it's a year long , uh , process , and it's an injection once a week . you come in weekly for the first four , five weeks , i believe . and then , after that , it's once a month . you do get a stipend for partici- for participating in the study , and parking is validated , and whatever else that you need for the study .
[patient] okay , do you know how much the stipend is ?
[doctor] um , i will have to double check for you , and , you do n't have to be my patient , you just have to meet the criteria . so the criteria is a bmi greater than 30 , if you do n't have any other medical condition . or , a bmi greater than 27 , if you do have another medical condition , like your cholesterol . um , a bmi greater than 27 would quali- uh , qualify you .
[patient] i have a friend who might be interested , and she does have diabetes .
[doctor] if she has d- diabetes , then she wo n't qualify .
[patient] okay , you ca n't if you ... if you have diabetes , got it .
[doctor] correct . yeah , the only thing that , um , they can not have , really , is diabetes . so , either a psychiatric disease , or schizophrenia , bipolar , things like that .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] but , if they have hypertension , high cholesterol , things like that ... they can definitely sign up .
[patient] and they can , okay . thank you for explaining that .
[doctor] of course . so , do you want me to try to get you into that study ? or , would you just like to try , me to prescribe something ? it's kind of up to you .
[patient] i think i'll just wait for a little bit now .
[doctor] all right , sounds good . i'll give you the information for the research , it's just in my office . um , it is a different phone number , though . so then , if you're interested , just call us within a month , because i do n't know how long , uh , the , the wait will be .
[patient] okay , will do .
[doctor] perfect . so , let me go grab your discount card for the unithroid . um , when you go in to activate it , the instructions are on this card , and then you use your insurance ... then , show them this , and ask how much it'll cost . if it's too expensive , just let me know .
[patient] i will . thank you so much for your help on that .
[doctor] you're welcome . then , what i did is , i gave you a topical antibiotic , plus i gave you the benzoyl peroxide . so , the peroxide may bleach your sheets , but , you want to make sure to take it and apply it at night , so you do n't have a reaction from the sun during the day .
[patient] okay , i can do that .
[doctor] but , you do also want to make sure that you do n't mess up your sheets .
[patient] okay , sounds good .
[doctor] um , so , that's that . and then , let's see how you do on the other medications . i think this will , this will get better . in the meantime , a low-carb diet , avoid alcohol and fatty foods , and low chole- cholesterol foods .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] and again , once you finish your dose of vitamin d , for the vitamin d deficiency , you're gon na start with the 2000iu daily , so that you're able to maintain those levels . sound good ?
[patient] yes , that sounds great .
[doctor] i really think your liver enzymes are going to get better once you lose the weight , though .
[patient] okay , that would be great .
[doctor] since we stopped your birth control , we can try once called phexxi , which is kind of like a spermicide , basically .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] and you just apply it before intercourse .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] if you need some , uh , just let me know .
[patient] okay , i will . i'll let you know .
[doctor] okay , perfect . so , stay put for me now . i'm going to go see if they have discount samples , and bring you that prescription . and then , i'm going to order the labs for next time .
[patient] okay , great , thank you so much .
[doctor] you're welcome .
[doctor] so , under the plan , under abnormal liver enzymes , they have improved since discontinuation of her birth control . under abnormal weight gain , her dexamethasone suppression test was normal . two out of three salivary cortisol tests were normal , not consistent with cushing's , and therefore we're ruling out cushing's . under her hirsutism , her androgen levels were normal . for the acne vulgaris , the epiduo was not covered , so we'll try benzoyl peroxide with clindamycin , and remove the previous information . on the hyperthyroidism , we'll print out her prescriptions . unithroid should be better priced with the discount card , and we'll repeat levels of everything before next visit . thanks .",3536.217391304348,"Benzoyl Peroxide.

MEDICAL NOTE:

CHIEF COMPLAINT

Hypogonadism.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Mr. Paul Edwards is a 59-year-old male, an established patient, who presents to the clinic today for hypogonadism. He was last seen on 11/24/2020. The patient’s history includes positive for HIV, and today he is concerned with gynecomastia.

The patient is doing well, overall, and feels the testosterone is helping. He reports weight stability, feels lively, good, more vigorous, and he is sleeping well. He also thinks the testosterone is having a positive effect on his blood work. He endorses that his triglycerides have always been elevated and adds that they were as high as 265 mg/dL. The patient presented a copy of his bloodwork, showing a significant decrease in his cholesterol after 5 months. Mr. Edwards questioned if the changes in his blood work were due to the testosterone. He also noted that his red blood cell count has not increased. The patient inquired about possible benefits of Indole-3-carbinol, which is a broccoli extract for estrogen control.

Currently, the patient is dosing 140 ng/dL of testosterone per week and inquired if his dose could be increased to 175 ng/dL. He recalled that he had recently injected testosterone before his last testosterone blood work was performed; last testosterone levels were greater than 1500 ng/dL. The patient confirms continued daily use of Finasteride and Cialis, prescribed by me, and stated he needs a refill for both.

Mr. Edwards mentioned he is taking correct steps to get his life ""together."" He also uses a med calendar to help with medication compliance.

PAST HISTORY

Medical
HIV

SOCIAL HISTORY

Utilizes med calendar to support medication compliance.
Actively trying to get his life together.

CURRENT MEDICATIONS

Cialis 5 mg tablet by mouth on days he exercises, 2.5 mg tablet by mouth on days without exercise.
Finasteride 5 mg half tablet daily.
Testosterone cypionate 140 mg.

RESULTS

PSA 0.6 ng/mL.
Triglycerides 145 mg/dL.
Total testosterone 1500 ng/dL, 11/24/2021.

ASSESSMENT

• Hypogonadism.

PLAN

I recommend maintaining current management. The patient’s last testosterone levels were greater than 1500 ng/dL, although this level was likely related to his recent injection. He requested an increase to his testosterone cypionate from 140 mg to 175 mg, which I denied due to his already high testosterone levels. I counseled the patient on the risks associated with high testosterone levels and Indole-3-carbinol and it’s lacking evidence to support his estrogen levels. The last time his estradiol levels were checked, they were normal; recommend annual screening.

I provided paper prescription refills for Cialis and Finasteride.","[doctor] next patient is paul edwards , date of birth is january 15th 1962 . so he's a 59 year old hiv positive gentleman here for hypogonadism . patient was last seen on november 24th 2020 . his notable things are number one , he is on 1 milliliter every 10 days , uh , his levels were less than 300 to begin with . he's on finasteride currently . he also takes cialis daily so he takes all his pills just from me . um , patient's other area of concern is gynecomastia which is ... which we will discuss with him today . his last psa was 0.66 and his last testosterone was greater than 1,500 .

[patient] uh , it helped me out . i feel good , more vigorous , sleeping well and i think it's having some positive effects . not so much physically because like i said i've- i've been this way my whole life , but i'm seeing some good improvements in my bloodwork .
[doctor] okay , well that's good .
[patient] so the finasteride i'm only taking half a pill , it's the 5 milligram one .
[doctor] yeah , i remember you telling me that .
[patient] and cialis , on the days i work out i take 5 milligrams otherwise i take two and a half milligram pills , but , uh , i have been out of it .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] but overall i'm doing well , i'm actually taking the correct steps to get my life together .
[doctor] good . it's always great to hear . well let's take a look . uhm , i'm gon na listen to your heart and lungs .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] please use my general exam template , all right . just take a few breaths .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] in and out .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] all right , everything sounds good , no concerns there .
[patient] great . so i wanted to show you something .
[doctor] sure .
[patient] look at this .
[doctor] okay , this is your cholesterol ?
[patient] yeah , my cholesterol and triglycerides . uh , i used to have high triglycerides , you see they were 265 milligrams per deciliter , and i took my first dose of the testosterone on the 28th .
[doctor] right .
[patient] now 5 months later look at my numbers .
[doctor] wow , that's remarkable .
[patient] is it the test ? it's the only change .
[doctor] i do n't know , i have n't honestly seen many guys over the years that have cholesterol problems and this . i mean there's a big correlation between diabetic control and testosterone replacement , meaning those who get good levels of their test see their diabetic control improve .
[patient] yeah .
[doctor] but i have n't seen a lot of data on the impact on cholesterol . regardless , we will take it .
[patient] i agree . i was very impressed with my triglycerides and was just wondering if the test may be what's helping .
[doctor] yeah , that's an unbelievable difference .
[patient] 145 milligrams per deciliter from 265 milligrams per deciliter is awesome . i also read that it- it's cardioprotective .
[doctor] absolutely .
[patient] my red blood cell count has increased .
[doctor] yeah , i saw that . it's fine though .
[patient] stable .
[doctor] your psa today is also , uh , is good also . it's , uh , .6 i think .
[patient] yeah . , is it ?
[doctor] yeah , it was .5 last year and anything under 4 is good .
[patient] nice , that's good news .
[doctor] so it just needs to be checked every year or so .
[patient] so in terms of , uh , estrogen control i've been hearing that indole-3-carbinol , or broccoli extract , supposedly can improve my estrogen levels . have you ever heard of it ?
[doctor] yeah , i've heard of it but i have n't had anybody consistently use it . i mean , your levels are fine and we checked your estra- estradiol and it was not elevated , so .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] i would argue that we could test that in the fall if you want , but we do n't need to do , uh , do any more tests ... any more than test once a year , excuse me .
[patient] okay , what about increasing my testosterone to 175 milligrams ? i'm at 140 now .
[doctor] well , your levels are high .
[patient] are they right now ?
[doctor] well , i mean they were last time .
[patient] yeah but i just- just injected though , or i had right before that was taken .
[doctor] i know . i know you had then , uh , when did you inject this time ?
[patient] i figure i'm on my eighth day today .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] so i'm due to dose on thursday or friday .
[doctor] all right .
[patient] i have a little med calendar and i put checks and ts on it . that helps me .
[doctor] that's a great idea . so look , the biggest issue i've seen , even if your levels today are around 700 , is that your peaks are getting greater than 1,500 , putting you at a higher chance of needing to come off due to blood thickness . and your risk will only astronomically go up the higher the dose that we go on .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] you look well , your levels are good and you're feeling well .
[patient] yeah , i'm feeling good .
[doctor] i'm going to be blunt . unfortunately this happens often where you're feeling good but you want to feel really good . i mean , i get it and this is why people get into problems with this stuff , right ? it's like , back in the day when it was n't prescribed by doctors and people would get it at gyms and stuff and they would take huge doses . and then they would have a heart attack at 50 .
[patient] yeah , they have to be taking a lot .
[doctor] likely they are taking more than testosterone , but still .
[patient] and they are taking stuff for a long time .
[doctor] true . but right now i would not change your dose .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] make sense ?
[patient] it does , i appreciate the discussion .
[doctor] no problem . what pharmacy are you using ? have you changed it or anything ?
[patient] no changes , i use walmart pharmacy . i do need more cialis and finasteride .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] i would prefer the paper prescription .
[doctor] for all of them ?
[patient] sure .
[doctor] all right , will do . i'm gon na get your prescriptions .
[patient] okay , thank you .",440.8181818181818,"Cialis 5 mg tablet by mouth on days he exercises, 2.5 mg tablet by mouth on days without exercise.

MEDICAL NOTE:

CHIEF COMPLAINT

Follow-up.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Nicole Miller is a 71-year-old female who presents for follow-up. The patient was called in for a follow up with me for chronic congestive heart failure with diastolic dysfunction. Her BNP had been 3000 in 03/2021, up to 6000 in 04/2021. She was increasingly dyspneic. We had changed her furosemide to torsemide at 20 mg by mouth daily. The patient is not on a potassium supplement currently. Her lisinopril had also been increased up to 10 mg daily in 03/2021.

I last saw her in 04/2021, and she had reported being interested in having her right knee replaced this summer at East Metropolitan Hospital, so it was recommended that we work to control her cardiovascular status prior to surgery. She is currently scheduled to have surgery on 06/24/2021. She plans to discontinue clopidogrel a week before her surgery.

The patient states that she has lost approximately 3 to 3.5 pounds since her last visit in 04/2021. Some of which may be water weight decreasing. She did report experiencing bilateral leg cramps which she treated with consumption of pickle juice, which did resolve the cramps. She thought the cramps were related to her being cold.

She is still taking iron supplementation. She denies any concerns with defecation.

Regarding her prior symptoms of heartburn, she denies any recent gastrointestinal issues. She notes that her heartburn was severe at one point but resolved after trying Prilosec for 2 weeks in 01/2021. She denies any issues with heartburn since that time and has stopped taking Prilosec altogether. She has since transitioned back to her original ""stomach medication"".

The patient is due for a colonoscopy. She is currently double covered with Medicare and private insurance.

PAST HISTORY

Medical
Chronic Congestive Heart Failure.
Iron deficiency Anemia.

Medications
Prilosec.

FAMILY HISTORY

No family history of colon cancer.

CURRENT MEDICATIONS

Torsemide 20 mg by mouth daily.
Lisinopril 10 mg daily.

RESULTS

Magnesium 1.7, hemoglobin WNL, potassium 3.9, creatinine 0.7, BUN 23.
03/2020 Hgb A1c 5.5.

ASSESSMENT

• Chronic congestive heart failure with mixed presentation.
• Preop examination.
• Diabetes mellitus.
• Colonoscopy

PLAN

Chronic congestive heart failure with mixed presentation.
She had an exacerbation of CHF earlier in the spring. We switched her from furosemide to torsemide and symptomatically, she is doing a lot better. She is about 1.5 kg down in weight. Her breathing is nonlabored. We are going to repeat an EKG today. Otherwise, continue her current regimen. Labs were checked and creatinine is appropriate. Her magnesium is below the preferred 2 at 1.7, with some occurrence of bilateral leg cramping, therefore we will start her on magnesium supplement.

Preop examination.
She is going to be having a right knee replacement at the end of 06/2021. We will schedule a preop check the first week or two of June prior to the surgery. She will discontinue clopidogrel for one week prior to knee replacement surgery; we will provide a reminder to patient of this as well.

Diabetes mellitus.
A1c is 5.5 on last check, so there is no need for a further A1c today. She may need another one prior to her surgery next month.

Colonoscopy.
The patient is overdue for a colonoscopy, which we will try to have done at County Hospital in the next month, prior to a change in her insurance. This is just a screening colonoscopy that she is overdue for. No family history of colon cancer.

The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.

INSTRUCTIONS

Complete EKG today. Schedule a preop checkup 1st or 2nd week of June. Start magnesium supplement. Call the clinic with any questions or new symptoms.","[doctor] next patient is nicole miller . date of birth is 09/18/1949 . patient was called for a follow-up with me for chronic congestive heart failure with diastolic dysfunction . bmp's been , uh , 3,000 in march , and is about six- was up to 6,000 in april . she was increasingly dyspneic . we changed her furosemide and torsemide 20 milligrams by mouth daily . uh to note , the patient is not currently on potassium supplement . her lisinopril had- has also been increased up to 10 milligrams daily in march . also did when i saw her last april . she reported being interested in having her right knee replaced this summer at east metro . it was recommended that we work to control her cardiovascular status before surgery .
[doctor] hey , miss miller , how are you today ?
[patient] i'm doing okay , thank you .
[doctor] i asked you to come in today because we want to keep- we want you to have this knee surgery this summer but we want to keep a close eye on you to make sure a week before your surgery you do n't suddenly go into congestive heart failure and it gets postponed .
[patient] yeah , that would not be good .
[doctor] i see you're scheduled on the 24th for surgery .
[patient] yeah , that's right .
[doctor] okay , good . well it looks like you have lost about 3 , 3 and a half pounds since i saw you last in april . some of that might be water weight , but still , this is positive .
[patient] yeah , i noticed that too . i think the oxyglutinine is helping as well . my urgency to use the bathroom is much better .
[doctor] well that's great .
[patient] yeah , i , i'm pleased about it too .
[doctor] you ever get leg or finger cramps or anything like that ?
[patient] yeah , i had leg cramps the other day , but i thought it might , was maybe just because i was cold as i had my ceiling fan on and fell asleep . i had cramps when i woke up in both legs right here . um i drank pickle juice and it went right away .
[doctor] well do n't , do n't get crazy with the pickle juice because all of the salt in it .
[patient] haha , i know , i only drink about 4 ounces or so .
[doctor] okay good .
[patient] um it went away so i did n't drink anymore . i find it works a lot better than trying to put some cream on my leg .
[doctor] sure just , just keep it in moderation .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] and then are you still on an iron supplement ? and are you using the bathroom okay ?
[patient] uh yes , everything is good .
[doctor] good . how is your heart burn doing ? any problems with that ?
[patient] no , it did get bad for a while so i tried to take some prilosec and then stopped that other one .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] um i did that for like , gosh , i think it was two weeks back in january and have n't had any problems since .
[doctor] great .
[patient] um and after i stopped taking that um i went back to the stomach one , so i'm doing good now .
[doctor] okay and you're still due for a colonoscopy , correct ?
[patient] uh yeah , that's right .
[doctor] all right , let's review your blood work real quick . i checked your hemoglobin level because you have had some anemia in the past but that is still doing great .
[patient] good , that's a relief to hear .
[doctor] your potassium is 3.9 so it's holding steady on the torsemide . your creatinine was .7 not .8 so you're doing well with kidney numbers . your bun may be a tiny bit elevated at 23 which is the number we look for for dehydration sometimes the kidneys , but it's not terrible . um so when i look at your numbers as a whole i think you're tolerating the torsemide okay at the current dose . i also sent out to look at the heart failure number- i sent to look at your heart failure number . there is a test called a bmp that i was monitoring and in march it was up to 3,000 and then went up to 6,000 in april before i made the change . i'm still waiting for those results .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] all in all i think you're doing good on paper though .
[patient] what about , um what's it called , a1c ? does that show up ?
[doctor] um i do n't think i ordered it but i could . your last a1c was 5.5 in march .
[patient] all righty .
[doctor] so your blood sugar is a little bit high , it was 169 today but that kind of depends on what you ate and you were n't fasting for the blood check so i might have to repeat that test for pre-op , but i do n't think we need to do it today .
[patient] all righty that sounds good .
[doctor] i checked your magnesium level because sometimes you uh urinate out magnesium with the water pills but it was normal at 1.7 and your blood pressure is also looking good .
[patient] okay great . that all sounds awesome .
[doctor] all right let's take a quick listen .
[doctor] use my general physical exam template .
[doctor] and take a couple of deep breaths for me .
[doctor] your lungs sound pretty good to me so keep doing what you're doing . um uh , like i said , i think you're doing good overall but let's just talk about a few things .
[patient] all righty .
[doctor] so we often like to keep people with heart problems on magnesium and get their levels up to around the 2-ish range . yours is a little bit less than 2 and we want that 2-ish range because it can help stabilize the heart muscle . so i might recommend putting you on magnesium supplement . it's supposed to be twice a day so that's kind of annoying , but i know you're on other medicines twice a day too , so i think you'll do fine .
[patient] yeah , that'll be okay .
[doctor] great . now before surgery we'll have to get you off your clopidogrel for a week beforehand .
[patient] yes , okay , i have everything written down on my phone , and i have a letter taped to the side of my bed to remind me .
[doctor] perfect ! we will give you a reminder as well . we will also need to complete a pre-op check within two weeks of your surgery during the first or second week of june .
[patient] okay , i'll put that down .
[doctor] you might also have to repeat an ekg before surgery which we could do today . i know i'm sure it feels like you're doing , you're always doing ekgs . um we do n't need to any x-rays of your chest because you had one recently , and we do n't need any more blood work because we did that today .
[patient] yeah , i do a lot of ekgs . i'm basically a regular . but i'm happy to do one today , no problem .
[doctor] lastly , once we get your knee surgery , um we , we should think about getting you a colonoscopy . we can do it here locally because you have medicare . do you have private insurance also ?
[patient] yeah , i have both .
[doctor] okay so yes , you can get it , your colonoscopy , wherever you'd like .
[patient] okay , well my husband's insurance may be running out . might we be able to get the procedure done sooner ? maybe in the next 30 days ? is that okay ?
[doctor] um i can put it in right now for , uh , for county for the next 30 days , and they might be able to get you in within the next few weeks . it should not take , it should not make you ineligible for the surgery . in other words completing a colonoscopy would not delay your surgery .
[patient] okay , good .
[doctor] so let me see . i've been doing one of two things at every one , and everyone is great so it depends more on timing availability of their or for the colonoscopy . we can send you to dr. martin for the surgery who is at county surgical services down here or the other option is valley medical , and they do it at springfield .
[patient] okay , that sounds good .
[doctor] i think either direction they're good technicians of the colon .
[patient] okay , yeah whatever you can get me in , that works great .
[doctor] so i'll call around . now if you get that done and they tell you 10 years then you'll be good to go .
[patient] great , thank you .
[doctor] you're welcome . have a great day . let us know if you need anything else , okay ?
[patient] sounds good .
[doctor] all right , assessment and plan .
[doctor] chronic chf . mixed presentation . had a exacerbation of cf , chf earlier in the spring . we switched her from a furosemide to torsemide and symptomatically she is doing a lot better . she's about 3 , 3 and a half pounds down in weight . breathing is non-labored . going to repeat ekg today but otherwise continue with her current regimen . labs checked and creatinine is appropriate .
[doctor] uh number 2 , pre-op examination . she is , she's having a right knee replacement end of june . also , she would like to have a colonoscopy performed which we'll try to have done at uh bartley regional , rightley regional hospital in the next month , uh , prior to a change in her insurance . this is just a screening colonoscopy that she is overdue for . no family history of colon cancer .
[doctor] uh the next one is diabetes . a1c is 5.1 on the last check so no need for further a1c today . she may need another one prior to her surgery next month though . thanks .",344.6,"Torsemide 20 mg by mouth daily.

MEDICAL NOTE:

CHIEF COMPLAINT

Left ankle pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Matthew Murphy is a pleasant 20-year-old male who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of left ankle pain. The onset of his pain began 2 days ago, when he stepped off of a curb and landed on his left ankle wrong. He denies hearing a pop at the time of the injury, however, he describes his ankle as feeling extended and stretched. He was able to ambulate back to his house after the incident but with pain. He denies any previous injuries to his left ankle. His pain is localized to the lateral aspect of his left ankle and can be rated at 8 out of 10 without medication. When taking ibuprofen his pain level is 7 out of 10. He states he has also iced and elevated his ankle.

SOCIAL HISTORY

Patient reports that he has been working from home since the start of COVID-19 and enjoys taking lots of walks.

MEDICATIONS

Patient reports taking ibuprofen.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Musculoskeletal: Patient reports left ankle pain.

VITALS

Vitals are slightly elevated due to pain level but are otherwise stable.

PHYSICAL EXAM

NEURO: Normal strength and sensation bilaterally.
MSK: Examination of the left ankle: Ecchymosis noted over the lateral malleolus. Edema is present. Tenderness to palpation laterally. No joint laxity appreciated. No bony tenderness to palpation of the foot. Capillary refill is brisk at less than 3 seconds bilaterally. Strong dorsalis pedis pulses bilaterally.

RESULTS

These reveal no fracture or bony abnormalities.

ASSESSMENT

Left ankle sprain of the lateral ligament complex.

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I have had a lengthy discussion with the patient in regards to his current symptoms. We discussed that his symptoms are consistent with an ankle sprain of the lateral ligament complex. The nature of the diagnosis and treatment options were discussed. At this time he will continue to follow the RICE protocol. He will continue to take NSAIDs as needed for pain and swelling. He will also be placed into an Aircast for ankle stabilization and will be provided crutches in order to remain non-weight-bearing. We discussed that it may be a few days before he feels able to tolerate walking. I also advised him that his symptoms will likely start to improve significantly over the next 4 to 6 days.

INSTRUCTIONS

The patient will follow up with me in 2 weeks to assess his progress, sooner if needed.

MEDICAL NOTE:

CHIEF COMPLAINT

Right ankle pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Carolyn Jones is a pleasant 38-year-old female who presents to the clinic today for evaluation of right ankle pain.

The patient sustained an injury to her right ankle when she slipped and fell on ice while taking her garbage out yesterday. This was her first right ankle injury. She believes she heard a pop at the time, but denies any associated numbness or tingling. Initially, she was unable to bear weight on the ankle and required help getting inside; however, she is now able to slightly bear weight but ambulates with an antalgic gait. Ice, elevation, and ibuprofen have been helpful at reducing her pain. She rates her current pain as 4/10, her pain without medication as 6/10, and her pain with medication as 1/10.

Of note, the patient participates in an intramural soccer league but has not been able to play since this injury.

MEDICAL HISTORY

The patient reports that she has had several ankle injuries in the past. This is her first right ankle injury.

SOCIAL HISTORY

The patient reports that she has a history of playing sports. She played soccer in college and is now in an intramural soccer league.

MEDICATIONS

The patient reports that she has been taking ibuprofen.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Musculoskeletal: Reports right ankle pain.
Neurological: Denies right ankle numbness or tingling.

VITALS

Normal

PHYSICAL EXAM

GAIT: antalgic gait
CV: Brisk capillary refill to less than 3 seconds. Strong dorsalis pedis pulse.
NEURO: Sensation in the right ankle is intact to light touch distally.
MSK: Examination of the right ankle: Ecchymosis over the lateral malleolus associated with trace edema in that area. Tenderness to palpation over the anterolateral soft tissue. No laxity on anterior drawer testing or inversion stress testing. No bony tenderness on palpation of the foot or ankle area. Findings are consistent bilaterally.

RESULTS

X-ray images of the right ankle were obtained and reviewed today. These reveal no evidence of fracture.

ASSESSMENT

Lateral ligament complex sprain, Right ankle.

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, her symptoms are consistent with a right ankle sprain of the lateral ligament complex, more specifically the anterior talofibular ligament. We had a lengthy discussion regarding the nature of this injury and the course of treatment. I advised her to keep her leg elevated when she is seated and continue to ice her ankle. She should also continue taking ibuprofen as-needed for pain and inflammation management. She will be placed in an Aircast to help stabilize her ankle, and I am going to order crutches so she can remain non-weight-bearing for the next couple of days. At that point, she can start bearing weight on the ankle as tolerated.

INSTRUCTIONS

The patient will follow up in 2 weeks.

[doctor] okay alright that that sounds good have you ever injured that foot and ankle before
[patient] you know i've had a lot of injuries to my ankle but i've never hurt this ankle before i just realized an error
[doctor] okay you know and i see here that you have a history of playing sports looks like you played soccer in college and then played a little bit of a inner marrow soccer now

Chief Complaint: Right knee pain
Secondary Complaints: diabetes

MEDICAL NOTE:

CHIEF COMPLAINT

Right knee pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Virginia Phillips is a pleasant 53-year-old female who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of right knee pain. The onset of her pain began 7 days ago, when she was playing basketball and another player ran into her. She states that she fell to the ground and landed on her side. She denies hearing or feeling a pop at the time of the injury. The patient localizes her pain to the medial aspect of her knee. She used ice and an ACE wrap right after the injury. Today, she notes that she has been doing exercises, ice, and Mobic for pain control.

MEDICAL HISTORY

The patient reports she is a diabetic who takes her blood sugar every morning.

SOCIAL HISTORY

Patient reports that she plays basketball at the Y for fun.

MEDICATIONS

Patient reports that she takes metformin 500 mg twice a day.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Musculoskeletal: Reports right knee pain.

PHYSICAL EXAM

MSK: Examination of the right knee: No pain to palpation of the lateral aspect of the right knee. Pain with palpation on the medial aspect of the knee. Ecchymosis and swelling on the medial aspect of the knee. Effusion is appreciated. Decreased ROM. Negative varus and valgus stress test.

RESULTS

X-rays of the right knee taken in office today reveal the bony alignment in good position. There is no evidence of any fractures. There is effusion present.

ASSESSMENT

Right knee pain, possible medial collateral ligament strain.

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I have had a lengthy discussion with the patient in regard to her current symptoms. I have prescribed the patient meloxicam 15 mg once a day to treat the pain and swelling. She was advised to stop taking any anti-inflammatory such as Motrin or Advil. I have also recommended that the patient attend formal physical therapy to strengthen her right knee. I have also advised her to continue to use the ACE wrap and wear a right knee brace for a few days. She should continue light walking with her brace on. The patient was advised to stop basketball until she follows up in 7 days.

Regarding her diabetes, she should continue to monitor her blood sugars daily. She should reach out to her primary care physician if she sees an increase in her blood sugars due to loss of activity.

INSTRUCTIONS

The patient will follow up with me in 7 days to check on her progress. If her swelling has not improved, we will consider obtaining a CT or MRI of the right knee to evaluate for a possible medial collateral ligament strain.

---------------------------------------------","[doctor] hi virginia how're you today
[patient] i'm good thanks how are you
[doctor] good so you know you got that knee x-ray when you first came in but tell me a little bit about what happened
[patient] i was playing basketball and jerry ran into me and the inside of my knee hurts
[doctor] okay did you fall to the ground or did you just kinda plant and he pushed and you went one way and your knee did n't
[patient] i did fall to the ground
[doctor] you did fall to the ground okay and did you land on the kneecap i mean did it hurt a lot were you able to get up and continue on
[patient] i landed on my side i was not able to continue on
[doctor] okay so you get off the off the court is jerry a good player you just got ta ask that question
[patient] not really
[doctor] no
[patient] he does n't have much game
[doctor] okay okay well you know i love basketball i'm a little short for the game but i absolutely love to watch basketball so it's really cool that you're out there playing it so tell me about a little bit about where it hurts
[patient] on the inside
[doctor] on the inside of it okay and after the injury did they do anything special for you or you know did you get ice on it right away or try anything
[patient] i had ice and an ace wrap
[doctor] you had ice and what
[patient] an ace wrap
[doctor] and an ace wrap okay now how many days ago was this exactly
[patient] seven
[doctor] seven days ago okay yeah your right knee still looks a little swollen for seven days ago so i'm gon na go ahead and now i also see that you're diabetic and that you take five hundred milligrams of metformin twice a day are you still you're still on that medication is that correct
[patient] correct
[doctor] and do you check your blood sugars every morning at home
[patient] every morning
[doctor] okay great and since this i'm the reason i'm asking all these questions i'm a little concerned about the inactivity with your your knee pain and you know how diabetes you need to be very you know active and and taking your medicine to keep that under control so you know may wan na continue to follow up with your pcp for that diabetes as we go through here and just watch your blood sugars extra as we go through that now i'm gon na go ahead and examine your your right knee and when i push on the outside does that hurt at all
[patient] no
[doctor] okay and when i push on this inside where it's a little swollen does that hurt
[patient] yes
[doctor] yeah okay i'm just gon na ask a question did you hear or feel a pop in your knee when you were doing this
[patient] i did not no
[doctor] you did not okay okay what are you doing for the pain today
[patient] some exercises ice and mobic
[doctor] okay okay so i'm gon na continue all of my exam when i go ahead and pull on your knee the first thing i'm looking at is i do see some ecchymosis and swelling on the inside of that right knee and when i push around that knee i can see that there is fluid in the knee a little bit of fluid in the knee we call that effusion so i can appreciate some of that effusion and that could be either fluid or blood at this point from the injury that you had now you do have pain with palpation on the medial aspect of that right knee and that's that's concerning for me when i'm gon na just i just wan na move your knee a little bit it does n't look like when i extend it and flex it that you have a full range of motion does it hurt a lot when i moved it back a little more than normal
[patient] yes it hurts
[doctor] okay okay yeah so you do have some decreased range of motion in that right knee now i'm just gon na sit here and and lay you back and i'm gon na pull on your knee and twist your knee a little bit okay you currently there is a negative varus and valgus stress test that's really important so here's what i'm thinking for that right knee i think you have may have a medial collateral ligament strain from you know maybe the twisting motion be right before you fell to the ground i want you to continue to use an ace wrap i'm gon na give you a right knee brace we're gon na wear that for a few days and then i'm gon na send you to physical therapy so we can continue strengthening the muscles around the right knee now that x-ray as far as the x-ray results that x-ray that i did it this morning in the office the the bony alignment's in good position i do n't see any evidence of any fractures i do notice the the effusion around the right knee just a small amount of fluid but we're just gon na continue to watch that i'm gon na give you a prescription i'd like you to stop taking any of the nonsteroidals that you're taking the motrin or advil whichever one of those and i'm gon na give you meloxicam fifteen milligrams and i want you to take that daily for the pain and swelling i want you to just continue exercising with the the braces and everything on so if you can you can get out and do some light walking that'll be good and then again for your diabetes like i said just continue to watch those blood sugars daily and if you start to see any significant increase in them because of your loss of activity just reach out to your primary care physician now do you have any questions for me
[patient] when can i play basketball again
[doctor] yeah that's a great question i'm gon na ask well my first off i want to see you back here in in seven days you know in a week i want you to make an appointment we're gon na relook at it we're gon na determine if that swelling got any worse and if we need to go on to potentially ordering like a cat scan or an mri of that knee to look and see if there was any significant damage to the ligament so that's for for sure for seven days you're not gon na be playing basketball now are you in a ligue or is that just you get like pick up basketball
[patient] i just played the wife with fun
[doctor] okay okay good that's a great activity like i said i wish i could play now i i also know your your family do n't they own that sports store down right off a main street that sells a lot of sporting equipment

RESULTS

An echocardiogram, obtained at an outside facility, was reviewed today. It demonstrates a preserved ejection fraction of 55%. Normal diastolic filling. Mild to moderate mitral regurgitation.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

1. CHF.
- Medical Reasoning: The patient’s recent epsiode resulting in the emergency room visit was likely caused by his dietary indiscretion and uncontrolled hypertension that we have been monitoring.
- Patient Education and Counseling: I reviewed the echocardiogram results with the patient and discussed the importance of following dietary restrictions. I encouraged the patient to take his medication on a consistent basis. I advised him to purchase a scale to weigh himself daily.
- Medical Treatment: He will continue Bumex 2 mg once daily. He was provided with a referral to a nutritionist in consultation for further assistance with his dietary requirements to lower his sodium intake.

2. Hypertension.
- Medical Reasoning: This is currently uncontrolled.
- Patient Education and Counseling: I explained the importance of taking his medication on a daily basis. I encouraged the patient to purchase a blood pressure cuff and track his blood pressures.
- Medical Treatment: He will continue Cozaar 100 mg daily as well as the Norvasc 5 mg once daily. I will order a renal artery ultrasound for further evaluation.

3. Systolic ejection murmur.
- Medical Reasoning. Stable.

Patient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.

INSTRUCTIONS

The patient was instructed to call me if he gains 3 pounds in 2 days.

MEDICAL NOTE:

CHIEF COMPLAINT

Right foot ulcer.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Jeremy Roberts is a 79-year-old male who presents today for evaluation of a right foot ulcer. He reports an ulcer on his right foot has been present for approximately 6 to 8 weeks. He first noticed the ulcer after working outside. There is no associated pain, however, he feels the ulcer may have worsened from when he first noticed it. He denies experiencing any fevers or chills. He does however experience tension headaches quite frequently. He denies any pain in his calves when he walks. At this time the patient does not have a podiatrist for yearly foot exams.

He is a diabetic and takes insulin. His blood sugar has been running higher than normal and his last hemoglobin A1c was higher than 9. Occasionally he will also experience numbness and tingling in his feet, especially with colder weather.

In terms of his heart disease, the patient sustained a heart attack in 2018 and underwent stent placement at the right coronary artery. He is currently taking aspirin 81 mg daily. He denies chest pain or shortness of breath.

MEDICAL HISTORY

Patient reports history of diabetes and heart disease. He sustained a heart attack in 2018.

SURGICAL HISTORY

Patient reports undergoing stent placement at the right coronary artery.

SOCIAL HISTORY

Patient reports he is a former smoker. He previously smoked 2 packs a day for 20 years and was able to stop smoking approximately 4 years ago. Currently he is not very active but he does work around the house.

MEDICATIONS

Patient reports taking aspirin 81 mg daily and insulin.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Constitutional: Denies fevers and chills.
Cardiovascular: Denies chest pain.
Respiratory: Denies dyspnea.
Skin: Patient reports right foot ulcer.
Neurological: Patient reports headaches and numbness and tingling in feet.

VITALS

No fever.
Blood pressure: 127/80
Heart rate: 60s

PHYSICAL EXAM

CV: 2/6 systolic ejection murmur heard at the left base.
RESPIRATORY: Clear to auscultation bilaterally
NECK: No jugular venous distention or carotid bruits
MSK: Examination of the right lower extremity: No palpable dorsalis pedis or posterior tibial pulses. There is a 2 x 3 cm ulcerated lesion on the right lateral foot near the 5th metacarpal metatarsophalangeal joint. No associated cellulitis. No pain to palpation of the right foot. There is associated granulation tissue and some slight purulent discharge from the wound.

ASSESSMENT

1. Non-healing ulcer, right foot
2. Diabetes
3. Coronary artery disease

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination findings today, I have had a lengthy discussion with the patient in regards to his current symptoms. We discussed that his right foot ulcer is fairly sizable and will require wound care. I advised him that the ulcer does not appear to be healing and that further studies will be needed to assess if he has adequate blood supply to heal his foot wound. He was advised that due to his diabetes it is possible surgical intervention such as stent placement or bypass surgery may be required to improve his blood supply. I also advised him that I believe we will be able to heal his wound. At this time, I have recommended continued wound care and for him to also continue taking aspirin 81 mg daily. We will order an arterial ultrasound of the lower extremities. He will also be referred to podiatry for a consult.

Regarding his diabetes, this appears to be unstable as the patient reports his last hemoglobin a1c was greater than 9 and is now experiencing a non-healing right foot ulcer. We discussed the importance of blood sugar control as this will impact his wound healing. At this time, I have recommended that he follow-up with his primary care physician for further care.

The patient's coronary artery disease is currently stable. It is recommended that he continue to take his statin as prescribed. I will contact his cardiologist for medical clearance should surgical intervention be required for his non-healing right foot ulcer.

[doctor] okay alright now what do you think caused this ulcer were you wearing some tight fitting shoes or did you have some trauma to your foot or
[patient] yeah i was you know i think initially i'm you know i was out in the backyard you know kind of you know doing some work and you know i know i you know i could've stepped on a nail or you know there was some other work but you know i'm always outside so i do n't know if that kind of led to anything or caused anything
[doctor] okay alright and have you had any fever or chills
[patient] no no no fever or chills you know i kinda you know get headaches pretty often i do n't know if that you know i do n't know if that's a stress or but you know always have like the tension headaches in the front
[doctor] okay and do you have do you have neuropathy where you get like numbing and tingling in your feet
[patient] occasionally yeah occasionally especially when it's like colder outside
[doctor] mm-hmm kinda feels like it takes a little longer to
[patient] warm up but yeah i kinda have some sensation in in all my extremities
[doctor] okay alright and then are you are you a smoker or did you smoke
[patient] i did back you know kind of years ago i did but yeah i have n't smoked anything in in good number of years
[doctor] okay alright when did you stop smoking
[patient] couple years ago maybe four or so years ago
[doctor] okay alright and how many packs a day would you smoke
[patient] gosh back then yeah was at least two
[doctor] okay alright how many years did you smoke for like twenty
[patient] yeah at least twenty yeah twenty plus years
[doctor] okay alright now any other symptoms do you have any problems when you walk down the street do you get any pain in your calves at all when you walk
[patient] no no no no pain you know just kind of you know it's just i know that it's there
[doctor] okay and you said you're active you're out in the yard and things like that do you go on long walks at all or no
[patient] no no you know it's you know i just kinda feel like i've been just trying to take it easy lately
[doctor] mm-hmm
[patient] but yeah most most of the stuff i've been doing is just kind of hanging around the house
[doctor] okay alright so we talked a little bit about your diabetes let's talk about your heart disease now your heart disease you had a heart attack in twenty eighteen we put a stent into your right coronary artery you're still taking your medications for that you're still on your aspirin
[patient] i am yes yeah i do the baby aspirin every day
[doctor] okay alright and any chest pain or shortness of breath or anything like that no no yeah no nothing more than yeah i would n't attribute anything
[patient] okay and do you have a podiatrist for your yearly foot exams
[doctor] no i i i do n't okay alright alright well let's go ahead i wan na just do a quick physical exam i'm just gon na be calling out some of my exam findings so your vital signs here in the office you do n't have any fever so that's good your blood pressure is great it's like one twenty seven over eighty and your heart rate is nice and slow in the sixties on your neck exam i do n't appreciate any jugular venous distention or any carotid bruits on your lung exam your lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally on your heart exam you do have a two out of six systolic ejection murmur heard at the left base and on your lower extremity exam i do n't appreciate any palpable dorsalis pedis or posterior tibial pulses there is a two by three centimeter ulcerated lesion on the right lateral foot near the fifth metacarpal metatarsophalangeal joint there is no associated cellulitis does it hurt when i press here
[patient] no
[doctor] there is no pain to palpation of the right foot there is associated granulation tissue and some slight purulent discharge from the wound okay so what does all that mean that just means that you have this ulcer that's you know fairly sizable with i think we need to do some good wound care on it let's talk a little bit about my assessment and plan so you know i you have a nonhealing ulcer of your right foot so we need to do some studies on you to see if you have an adequate blood supply to heal this foot wound and since you since you probably do n't because of your diabetes you're here in a vascular surgeon's office we may have to go ahead and talk about being able to open up some of your arteries to improve the blood supply to your foot so that might mean getting a stent to one of your arteries in your legs to open up the blood supply it might mean mean that we might have to do some bypass surgery to to improve the blood supply to your foot in order to heal that that wound i do think that you'll be able to heal it i do n't think that we need to do anything drastic i want you to continue with your aspirin because that will help
[patient] any questions
[doctor] yeah i mean is this do we have to do any more tests or anything what are you we're gon na do an arterial ultrasound i'm going to go ahead and order an arterial ultrasound of your lower extremities to see what the blood supply is like and then i'm gon na go ahead and order a podiatry consult because i want them to see this wound and improve the wound care that you're doing and then for your next problem your diabetes i wan na go ahead and talk to your primary care physician we need to get your diabetes better controlled because that impacts your wound healing as well okay
[patient] sure
[doctor] sure understood alright and for your last issue your coronary artery disease continue with your statin and i will talk to your cardiologist in case you need a procedure to see if you're cleared from a medical standpoint okay
[patient] okay perfect
[doctor] alright
[patient] perfect thank you so much

---------------------------------------------","[doctor] hi virginia how are you today what brings you in
[patient] i'm doing alright i started seeing this new pcp last year and you know she has been doing a lot of changes to my medication and making sure everything is up to date and she my noticed that my blood pressure has been quite high so she added to medications but and but i you know i've been taking them i've been really good and i i before i was n't but now i am and we're still having a hard time controlling my blood pressure so she thought it would be a good idea for me to see you especially since she noted some on my last blood work she said something about my kidneys
[doctor] okay yeah so okay let's before i dive into a lot of that tell me a little bit about how you've been feeling
[patient] i would say you know most of the days i feel fine i'm still busy at work i definitely can tell though when my blood pressure is high
[doctor] okay you measure it at home you you you measure your blood pressure at home
[patient] yeah i she wanted me to get a blood pressure cuff so i did start getting checking my blood pressures probably like a few times a week
[doctor] okay
[patient] and so then i noticed that it has been getting higher the other day was even as high as one seventy over ninety
[doctor] wow
[patient] so i did call my pcp and she increased the meds again
[doctor] yeah okay now i i just have a couple questions about that are you using a an electronic blood pressure recorder or do you have somebody help you at home
[patient] yeah she i have a a electronic one an electronic arm one
[doctor] okay okay yeah that's good that's good and have you ever tried do you go to cvs at all
[patient] yeah i i do but i've noticed like since the pandemic i do n't see the blood pressures anymore
[doctor] okay okay yeah i i thought the one down on main street they i thought they just brought that one back so
[patient] did they
[doctor] yeah
[patient] that's good to know
[doctor] you may wan na check that but okay so that's good but i what i'd like you to do with that is i'd like you to keep a record of them for me for my next visit with you so let's talk a little bit about your diet tell me how how is your diet what what are the what kind of foods do you like what do you eat normally
[patient] alright do you want the honest answer
[doctor] well yeah that would be better
[patient] so i really you know with everything going on i really been trying to get better but i mean during football season it's really difficult i really love watching my games so have a lot of pizza wings subs like i said i've been trying to cut down especially on days where there is no games but it probably could be better
[doctor] okay i think we all can say that but i do wan na just hey i do n't know that if you've tried it or not but there is a new restaurant down on fifth street and it is nothing but solids and i you know when i heard this i was like okay yeah it's just another these solids are absolutely amazing so if you ever get a chance yeah if you ever get a chance try try that i mean i think you would enjoy them because they're salads that they make are just out unbelievable so let me go ahead and i just have a few more questions and i'm gon na just ask these in in order and you just tell me and then we will come back and talk about them do you have any headaches
[patient] really just when my blood pressure gets really high i have some mild headaches but otherwise i do n't have it on a regular basis
[doctor] okay what about chest pain
[patient] no chest pain
[doctor] shortness of breath
[patient] no shortness of breath
[doctor] even with exertion
[patient] even with exertion
[doctor] okay do you have any swelling in your lower extremities at all that you noticed
[patient] not if i'm on my feet for a long time i'll notice a little bit of swelling but otherwise no
[doctor] okay and then a couple other family history questions anybody in the family have kidney disease or significant high blood pressure
[patient] both my parents do have high blood pressure and one of them did have kidney disease
[doctor] okay okay and in the the the form that you filled out when you came in it says that you are on ten milligrams of norvasc daily and carvedilol twenty five milligrams twice a day is those the medicines you're on
[patient] yes i was also on lisinopril before but with the adjustments yeah those are the ones i'm on
[doctor] okay and so here's where i think we are going to go do you take any nonsteroidals like advil or motrin or aleve
[patient] yeah just once in a while for my like any knee pain or back pain that i have but again not like everyday
[doctor] okay and then lastly what kind of alcohol intake do you have you know do you consider how many drinks a week is really what i'm looking for
[patient] i'll have a couple of beers during the week and like one or two on the weekends
[doctor] okay okay so lem me do a quick physical examination so i looked at your vitals when you came in today and your blood pressure it's still high it's one sixty nine over seventy four your heart rate was eighty eight and your oxygenation was ninety eight percent so those are all fairly good except that blood pressure's a little higher than we'd like to see now when i look at your neck i do n't see any jugular vein distention and i'm gon na listen here real quick no i do n't hear any carotid bruits i'm gon na listen to your lungs okay your lungs are clear and let me listen quickly to your heart i do hear that a two over six systolic ejection murmur and we'll we're gon na have to take a little bit look extra look at that that's when i i can hear an extra sound when i'm listening to your heart and you do have a small amount of one plus pitting edema bilaterally now i did so you do have that your diagnosis is uncontrolled hypertension you know and i think you're aware that that's what your your physician's been treating you for and most of the time this cause is is the cause of this is multifactorial it's not that there is just one thing causing it so we may need to be changing your medicine around and i'm gon na talk to your doctor but first thing before we make any more medication changes i want to order some tests first to rule out if there is any specific cause for this so first order will be a renal artery ultrasound and what i'm looking for there is that there is no areas of areas of narrowing in the the blood vessels of your kidneys that would be the cause of your hypertension in addition to that i'm gon na order a you get another urine collection some morning aldosterone levels reining levels and a twenty four hour urine and these things can really show me if there is any problems with your adrenal glands again this is a lot of big words but you know i'm i i'll write this all out for you i want you to decrease your alcohol i know you like those beers but let's bring it down to maybe one a week or two a week just to get those down lower and then your salt intake you need to be very judicious about decreasing that salt intake i'm gon na give you a referral to a nutritionist to discuss those changes for that you need and and they will help you get that cleared up and then finally stop taking any nonsteroidal medicines such as your advil or motrin the only thing i really want to want you taking is tylenol for any pain right now i am gon na prescribe one medicine and that's cardura four milligrams and i want you to take that once a day and that's good to see if that can help us with your blood pressure and then finally three weeks i'd like you to return i want you to record all of your blood pressures that you take over the next three weeks and bring them into the office but most importantly if you can try to take them at the same time everyday that would be beneficial for me any questions for me
[patient] no i i just it's a lot so i i'm hoping this will work and this will get it under control
[doctor] yeah i i think you know this will be you know this we're gon na spend some time together so i'm glad to have you as a patient but you know we got ta try to get this under control and i'm gon na i'll be talking to your pcp just to let them know that you know what my plans are and we'll stay real in sync on treating this as we move forward does that sound like a plan
[patient] that sounds good thank you
[doctor] okay take care i'll talk to you later

MEDICAL NOTE:

CHIEF COMPLAINT

Left arm pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

He reports that his left arm pain began approximately 2 weeks ago. He woke around 2:00 am with intense pain in his left arm and hand. He applied ice and after 2-3 hours, the pain improved and he was able to go back to sleep, the pain did not return until that evening. After several nights of experiencing the left arm and hand pain, he was seen by Betty Ross, PA-C. She suspected a pinched nerve and completed x-rays of the cervical spine, prescribed gabapentin and prednisone, and referred the patient to us. The patient has benefited from the gabapentin and prednisone, reporting improvement of pain at night.

The pain initially was encountered at night, but the patient notes that the symptoms carry into the next day. He denies pain when moving his neck, turning his head, and moving his shoulder.

Mr. Clark does report a history of a left finger injury, stating “it rarely works”, and neuropathy in one leg from his knee to his foot which he receives 1% disability for. The patient is a veteran.

PAST HISTORY

Medical
Peripheral neuropathy.

SOCIAL HISTORY

The patient is a veteran and receives 1% disability.

CURRENT MEDICATIONS

Gabapentin tablet.
Prednisone tablet.

PHYSICAL EXAM

Constitutional
Elderly Caucasian male in no apparent distress. Presents in wheelchair.

Neurologic
Upper extremities: 1+ bilateral biceps, triceps, brachioradialis, reflexes bilaterally, negative. Negative Hoffman's
Gait: Not assessed today.

Strength
Upper extremities: Normal throughout the biceps, triceps, deltoid, grip strength, and finger abduction, bilaterally.
Sensation: Intact to light touch throughout the upper and lower extremities.

Musculoskeletal
Cervical: Nontender over cervical spine. Mildly restricted cervical extension and right and left lateral rotation, which is symmetric, which gives him mild lateral neck pain, but no radicular pain. Spurling's maneuver is benign.

RESULTS

X-ray Cervical Spine, 06/04/2021.
Impression: Significant disc degeneration at C5-6 and to a lesser extent C4-5 and C3-4. Significant lower facet arthropathy. C6-7 and C7-T1 are difficult to visualize in the current x-rays.

ASSESSMENT

• Left upper extremity neuropathy, suspicious for cervical radiculopathy, possible contribution of peripheral neuropathy
• Neck pain in the setting of arthritis and disc generation

PLAN

I suspect that this is a flare of cervical radiculopathy. I am going to set him up for a cervical MRI. We will tentatively plan for a left C7-T1 epidural afterwards, although the exact level will be pending the MRI results. He will continue his home exercise program as well as twice daily gabapentin. We will follow up with him afterwards to determine his level of relief. He denies any blood thinners.

This plan was discussed in detail with the patient who is in agreement.

INSTRUCTIONS

Continue home exercise program and twice daily gabapentin. Schedule MRI and epidural injection. Follow-up after epidural.

---------------------------------------------","[doctor] dictating on donald clark . date of birth , 03/04/1937 . chief complaint is left arm pain . hello , how are you ?
[patient] good morning .
[doctor] it's nice to meet you . i'm dr. miller .
[patient] it's nice to meet you as well .
[doctor] so , i hear you are having pain this arm . is that correct ?
[patient] that's correct .
[doctor] okay . and it seems like it's worse at night ?
[patient] well , right now the hand is .
[doctor] mm-hmm .
[patient] and the thing started about two weeks ago . i woke up about two o'clock in the morning and it was just hurting something awful .
[doctor] uh- .
[patient] and then i laid some ice on it and it finally did ease up .
[doctor] okay , that's good .
[patient] so i got up , i sat on the side of the bed and held my arm down , thinking it would , like , help the circulation , but it did n't .
[doctor] okay , i see .
[patient] and so , after a while , when it eased off , maybe about four , five am , i laid back down and it did n't start up again .
[doctor] mm-hmm , okay .
[patient] um . i went back to sleep but for several nights this happened , like , over and over . so , i finally went to see the doctor , and i do n't really recall her name .
[doctor] okay . yeah , i think i know who you're talking about , though .
[patient] um , she's the one who sent me to you , so , i , i would , i would think so . but when i went to her after the third time it happened and she checked me out , she said it was most likely coming from a pinched nerve .
[doctor] probably . uh , do you notice that moving your neck or turning your head seems to bother your arm ?
[patient] uh , no .
[doctor] okay . is moving your shoulder uncomfortable at all ?
[patient] no .
[doctor] and do you notice it at other times besides during the night ?
[patient] um , some days . if it bothers me at night , then the day following , it usually will bother me some .
[doctor] okay . and do you just notice it in the hand , or does it seem to be going down the whole arm ?
[patient] well , it starts there and goes all the way down the arm .
[doctor] okay . have you noticed any weakness in your hand at all ?
[patient] uh , yes .
[doctor] okay . like , in terms of gripping things ?
[patient] yeah .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] uh , this finger , i hurt it some time ago as well .
[doctor] really ?
[patient] yeah . it does n't work properly . or , it works very rarely .
[doctor] gotcha . and did i hear that she gave you some prednisone and some oral steroids , or ?
[patient] uh , well , she gave me some numbing medicine . it helped a little bit . the other two were a neck pill and gabapentin . uh , you should have my full list in your notes , though . since then it has n't really bothered me at night . also , just so you know , i am a va and i'm one percent disabled from this leg , um , issues from my knees down to my feet .
[doctor] okay . is it neuropathy ?
[patient] uh , yep .
[doctor] gotcha . that is good to know . all right , well , let's go ahead and take a look .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] all right . so , to start , i'm gon na have you do something for me . uh , just go ahead and tilt your chin as far as you can down to your chest . okay , good . and now , go the other way , tilting your chin up as far as you can . now , does that seem to bother you at all ? okay . and now , come back to normal , just look and turn your head as far as you can that way . great . and now , as far as you can towards that wall . uh , does that seem to bother you at all ?
[patient] no . well , actually , i do feel a little strain .
[doctor] okay . so , you feel it in the neck a little bit ?
[patient] yeah , just a little strain .
[doctor] okay . uh , now squeeze my fingers as hard as you can with both hands . great . now , hold your arms like this .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] and i'm going to try to strain your arms and try to keep them as stiff as you can . do n't let me strain it . okay , good . good . now , when i , i'm just touching your hands like this . does it seem to feel about the same in both hands ?
[patient] uh , yes .
[doctor] okay . all right . so , i do agree with betty . uh , more than likely , this seems like it would be coming from your neck . that's the most common reason that causes what , what you're experiencing . and i looked at an x-ray of your neck , and you do seem to have a lot of arthritis there , and there does seem to be potential for a disc to be pushing on a nerve . and now , what i do n't have is an mri , which would show me , uh , kind of exactly where the nerve roots are getting pinched off .
[patient] i see .
[doctor] so , gabapentin can help a little bit with the nerve pain , and what i would like to do is potentially set you up for an epidural . and what that is is it , it's a focused anti-inflammatory medicine , excuse me , that works behind the nerve roops that , nerve roots that we are thinking might be getting squished off . it can often help alleviate your symptoms , and i do need to get an mri of your neck . um , i know we have had one of your lower back , but i need one of your neck to see exactly where the roots are getting pinched off . so , what i can do is tentatively set you up for an epidural , but before you do that , we do need to get that mri so i can see right where i need to put the medicine for your epidural . uh , what do you think of that ?
[patient] i think that sounds good to me .
[doctor] okay , good . and just to confirm , do you take any blood thinners ? i do n't think i saw any on your medicine list .
[patient] uh , no , i do n't .
[doctor] okay , good . and what i would have you do is continue with the gabapentin . um , are you taking 300 or 100 ?
[patient] um , not sure . my lady friend helps me handle this stuff .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] i am taking eliquis , though .
[doctor] okay . um , so whatever you are doing you can just keep doing it , and i'm going to set you up for the epidural and imaging study , um , just so i know right where to put the medicine . and i will follow up with you after s- um , that's in . we can do the shot , just to make sure your arm is feeling better . sound good ?
[patient] sounds good . for the last couple of nights , though , my neck has not been bothering me .
[doctor] okay . s- um , so , presumably what's happening , then , is when you're sleeping your neck is kind of gets off-tilt , uh , kilter , and it compresses the nerve roots there . now , if you think you're doing fine , we could hold off , but at the very la- least , i'd like to update that mri of yours and see what's going on , because probably this is something that will likely flare up again .
[patient] yeah , it , it has been for the last week , so , i understand .
[doctor] okay . all right . well , do you want to do that work-up and do the epidural , or do you think you're doing fine and you want to wait ?
[patient] well , my hand is still bothering me .
[doctor] okay . so , you're saying your neck is not bothering you but the hand is . okay . so then , let's just stick with the plan . mri of the neck , so we can see where the nerve roots may be compressed , that's giving your hand the issue . and then , we're going to set you up with the epidural .
[patient] okay . sounds good .
[doctor] all right . so , keep going with the gabapentin . i will order the imaging of your neck , and the shot will hopefully help some with those symptoms in your hand , and then we'll follow up afterwards .
[patient] all right . is the mri today ?
[doctor] um , you probably ca n't do it today , but let me talk with roy and see how soon we can get it done . just give me a quick minute , and then roy will come in and get things scheduled as soon as we can .
[patient] all right .
[doctor] all right . well , it was nice meeting you , my friend .

MEDICAL NOTE:

CHIEF COMPLAINT

Smoking cessation.

MEDICAL HISTORY

Patient reports a history of type 2 diabetes, gout, and a 2/6 Systolic ejection murmur.

SOCIAL HISTORY

Patient reports he is a smoker.

MEDICATIONS

Patient reports taking allopurinol.

VITALS

Oxygen Saturation: 98% on room air.
Blood Pressure: 128/88 mmHg.
Heart Rate: 68 beats per minute.
Respiratory Rate: 16 breaths per minute.

PHYSICAL EXAM

Neck
- General Examination: Neck is supple without lymphadenopathy. No carotid bruits.

Respiratory
- Auscultation of Lungs: Clear bilaterally. No expiratory wheezes, rales, or rhonchi.

Cardiovascular
- Auscultation of Heart: Regular rate. 2/6 systolic ejection murmur.

Hematology/Lymphatic/Immunology
- Palpation: No enlarged lymph nodes.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

1. Nicotine dependence.
- Medical Reasoning: The patient has a long history of smoking cigarettes. He is currently smoking 1.5 packs per day. He is highly motivated to cease smoking as he is preparing to become a father.
- Patient Education and Counseling: I applaud the patient on making this first step to stop smoking. I reassured him that with absolute 100% certainty that I will be with him every step of the way. I explained to the patient that stress can often be a trigger for smoking. He received handouts today for common smoking triggers. I advised him to be watchful and monitor his stress level, not only regarding work, but also his impending fatherhood. The patient and I discussed coping mechanisms for when he encounters stressful situations. I encouraged him to maintain his gym routine, engage in meditation, and try adding in yoga to help further reduce his stress levels. We discussed additional cessation aids.
- Medical Treatment: The patient has chosen his birthday, as a quit date. On that day, I am going to start him with a 21 mg nicotine patch, and the goal will be to decrease that over time. We will work together to decrease the dosage of the nicotine patch, so there are not necessarily any hard dates in mind. I recommend he change the patch location each day as that will help reduce or avoid any skin irritation that can occur if he re-uses the same location repeatedly.

2. Type 2 diabetes.
- Medical Reasoning: Stable.
- Patient Education and Counseling: We discussed that continuing to follow a healthy diet and perform regular exercise will help to maintain his blood glucose levels.
- Medical Treatment: We will continue to monitor his type 2 diabetes. Hemoglobin A1c is ordered to be completed by his next visit in 2 weeks.

3. History of gout.
- Medical Reasoning: Stable with medication.
- Patient Education and Counseling: I advised him to continue to watch for foods that will exacerbate his uric acid levels.
- Medical Treatment: He will continue his allopurinol.

Patient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.

INSTRUCTIONS

I would like to see him again in 2 weeks to discuss how things are going and to reevaluate the nicotine patch dosage.

MEDICAL NOTE:

CHIEF COMPLAINT

Right hip pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Elizabeth Reyes is a 56-year-old female who presents for the evaluation of pain in her right hip and groin region. Her symptoms started on 02/2020 and has progressively worsened. She is employed as an RN and notes that her symptoms began while she was working and walking around the infusion room at Johnson. Initially the pain would only happen when she took a step back, but the pain has progressed and now occurs with any type of movement involving her right hip and groin. She describes that her hip will sometimes “catch” when she moves, causing her to fall on occasion. The pain improves when she is still and stops moving. She rates her pain as 2-7/10.

Starting in 2018, the patient intentionally lost 110 pounds through Weight Watchers. She has maintained the weight loss and her weight has been stabile for the past 1 year. She has a history of several bulging discs, but the pain has significantly reduced due to her weight loss. Today, she reports no back pain.

She denies fever, chills, new onset of bowel or bladder dysfunction, tingling or numbness.

Examination of gait: Heel-walk and toe-walk are intact.
Cervical spine exam: No tenderness is elicited. Range of motion is full in all planes without pain. Spurling's test is negative.
Lumbar spine exam: Range of motion is decreased in extension and lateral flexion without pain. No tenderness is elicited in the midline.
Sacroiliac joint exam: Bilateral sacroiliac joints are nontender to palpation.
Bilateral hip exam: Range of motion is decreased in the right hip with pain in the groin on internal and external rotation. Resisted right hip flexion causes pain in the right groin region. Bilateral trochanteric regions are nontender to palpation.

Motor bulk and tone are normal in both lower extremities. Motor strength testing reveals no focal motor weakness in the lower extremities. Deep tendon reflexes are 1+ throughout. No focal sensory deficit is noted.

RESULTS

MR arthrogram of the right hip completed on 06/03/2021 reveals evidence of high-grade chondromalacia involving the anterosuperior right acetabulum with subchondral marrow edema and cyst formation.

ASSESSMENT

• Right hip degenerative joint disease.

PLAN

I discussed the clinical and radiological findings with the patient. Treatment options discussed are low impact exercises, use of analgesics as needed, and use of a cane to offload the right hip. She would like to proceed with a cortisone injection into her right hip joint. We will administer the injection today. I reviewed the procedure in detail, including the risks of the injection related to the use of steroid in the COVID setting. She understands the risks and would like to proceed with the injection.

INSTRUCTIONS

Schedule a follow up appointment in 3 months to assess her pain. If needed, a second injection may be administered.","[doctor] good morning ms. reyes !

- Medical Reasoning: The patient's physical exam is consistent with this diagnosis.
- Patient Education and Counseling: We discussed that his pumping function should improve in time. We also discussed that since he is compliant with his medications and presented to the cardiac cath lab quickly, he should recover. I advised the patient that he does not need to start a diuretic at this time.
- Medical Treatment: Continue taking lisinopril 20 mg a day. Prescription for Aldactone 12.5 mg daily provided. Order for labs provided. Repeat echocardiogram ordered to be completed in 2 months.

[patient] yes i have n't had any nausea but you know just slight fatigue it does n't seem to be overwhelming
[doctor] okay okay so we are gon na go ahead if it's okay with you and start your physical exam reviewing your vitals so vitals look good especially your oxygen especially with the chemotherapy you've been getting and the cough so your oxygen looks good so i'm happy with that so now i'm just examining your neck especially with your sore throat and i do n't appreciate any cervical lymphadenopathy and also no supraclavicular adenopathy listening to your heart you have a nice regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs that i appreciate now on your lung exam when you're taking some deep breaths i do notice some crackles in your lungs bilaterally and what that means is there is there is some faint sounds that i'm hearing which could represent some fluid there so on looking at your skin exam on your chest you do have some erythema on the anterior side of the chest on the left side and this could be related to the radiation so on your lower extremities i appreciate no edema and everything else looks good and thank you i know you did a chest x-ray before coming in so on your results for the chest x-ray it does look like you have some mild radiation pneumonitis which basically means some inflammation of the lungs most likely due to the radiation so what does this all mean so for your assessment and plan so for the first diagnosis the first problem of the lung cancer so what we're gon na do is we're gon na continue with the current regimen of your chemotherapy of the cisplacin and the etoside and we're gon na continue with your current dose of radiation at forty five grade and when that's complete we will repeat some imaging and hopefully you know the tumor will shrink down enough that we can remove it surgically okay for problem number two so the radiation pneumonitis so that's what causing that cough as well as some of the shortness of breath i know you're not experiencing it much now so what i'm gon na do for that is actually gon na prescribe you a low dose of prednisone and so that's an will help with the inflammation i'm gon na give you forty milligrams daily for five days and so hopefully that will help reduce the inflammation and so that you can continue with the radiation okay how does that sound so far
[patient] that sounds great thank you
[doctor] okay and then lastly for the painful swallowing that you're having so the inflammation you're having it not only in your lungs but it also in your esophagus as well so what i'm gon na do is prescribe you you're taking the the prednisone i'm also gon na give you a lidocaine swish and swallow and you can do that four times a day and so that will be able to help you so you can eat immediately after taking it and it can also help so that you can continue to take food and fluids prevent dehydration and any further weight loss

MEDICAL NOTE:

CHIEF COMPLAINT

History of right ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS).

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Sophia Brown is a 75 y.o. female who presents today for a new patient evaluation due to her history of right DCIS. She is doing well but wishes to establish care today for continued monitoring.

The patient underwent a screening mammogram in 10/2019 and was found to have a calcification in the right breast. She then had a right breast ultrasound on 11/03/2019 which revealed a mass at the 2 o’clock position, 11 cm from the nipple, in the retroareolar region. The report states the mass was 0.4 by 2.0 by 3.0 centimeters. She subsequently had an ultrasound-guided core needle biopsy on 12/05/2019 and pathology results revealed grade 2 ER-positive, PR-positive DCIS. The patient then had a lumpectomy with lymphadenectomy performed on 01/20/2020. The tumor was 8 mm with negative margins and the 5 lymph nodes removed were all benign. Pathology from the tumor confirmed DCIS. Her lumpectomy was followed by adjuvant radiation therapy. Endocrine therapy was also offered but the patient declined. She has since had a mammogram in 01/2021 which was normal. The patient also reports that she performs self-breast exams regularly at home.

Mrs. Brown is a G5P5 female and estimates that her last menstrual period was approximately 30 years ago. She is not currently and has never been on hormone replacement therapy.

The patient’s last colonoscopy was done in 2018. She had a sigmoid polypectomy at that time and pathology showed a tubular adenoma.

Her cholesterol was recently noted to be elevated and the patient reports that she is exercising and reducing fatty food intake accordingly. This is being followed by her primary care provider.

PHYSICAL EXAM

The ECOG performance status today is grade 0.
Breast: There are no palpable masses; however, there is some skin thickening at the medial inferior aspect of the right breast which may be radiation skin changes.

ASSESSMENT

Stage 0 ER/PR-positive invasive ductal carcinoma of the right breast.
The patient is status post lumpectomy with removal of 5 lymph nodes which were benign. She also underwent adjuvant radiation therapy but declined endocrine therapy. Today’s clinical examination shows no evidence of recurrent disease or other malignancy. She also had a negative mammogram in 01/2021.

[patient] no , i'm feeling good . i do my self breast exams religiously now and have n't felt anything since .
[doctor] perfect . i want to back up and go over your history so i can make sure everything in your chart is correct and i do n't miss anything . so , i'll tell you what we have in your chart from your other providers and you tell me if anything is wrong or missing . sound good ?
[patient] sounds good .
[doctor] great . so , i have that you were found to have a calcification in your right breast during a mammogram in october 2019 . was that just a normal screening mammogram , or was it done because you felt a lump ?
[patient] it was just a normal one you're supposed to get every so often .
[doctor] i see . and then it looks like you had an ultrasound of your right breast on november 3rd , 2019 , which revealed a mass at the two o'clock position , 11 centimeters from the nipple in the retroareolar region . the report states the mass was point four by two by three centimeters .
[patient] yes , that sounds right . hard to remember now , though .
[doctor] yep , definitely .
[doctor] based on those results , they decided to do an ultrasound-guided core needle biopsy on december 5th , 2019 . pathology results during that biopsy came back as grade two , er positive , pr positive , dcis , or ductal carcinoma in situ .
[patient] yes . unfortunately .
[doctor] i know . scary stuff . but you had a lumpectomy on january 20th , 2020 , which removed the eight millimeter tumor and margins were negative . the pathology confirmed dcis . looks like they also removed 5 lymph nodes , which , thankfully , were negative for malignancy . that's great !
[patient] yeah , i was definitely very relieved .
[doctor] and your last mammogram was in january 2021 ? and that was normal .
[patient] yes .

[doctor] i bet . sounds like fun .
[patient] it is .
[doctor] did you have any other pregnancies that were miscarriages or terminations ?
[patient] really , i did not .
[doctor] okay . so for the record , that's g5 p5 . and now that you're post-menopausal , are you currently or have you ever been on hormone replacement therapy ?
[patient] my primary care doctor gave me the option years ago but i decided against it .
[doctor] okay . and on your review systems form , you indicated that you've not had any recent weight loss or gain , headaches , bone pain , urinary symptoms , or blood in the stools . but you did indicate that you have some back pain , joint pain , and high cholesterol . tell me some more about those .
[patient] okay . so i've seen doctors for all of those . they've said , excuse me , the back and knee pain are age-related . and the cholesterol is a fairly new diagnosis , but i am working on exercise and cutting back on fatty foods to see if i can get it lower without any medication .
[doctor] okay . and your primary care doctor is following you for that , right ?
[patient] that's correct .
[doctor] okay . for medications , i have that you take coq10 , vitamin d , vitamin c , fish oil , and elderberry fruit . is that all right ?
[patient] yes , and that's all .
[doctor] okay . so for your medical history , it's high cholesterol and stage 0 er/pr positive invasive ductal carcinoma of the right breast . any surgeries other than the lumpectomy ?
[patient] i did have my tubes tied after my last baby , but that's all .
[doctor] okay . and how about family history ?
[patient] my mom had non-hodgkin's lymphoma and my dad had prostate cancer and heart disease , but i think that's it .
[doctor] all right . any family history of breast cancer ?
[patient] none .
[doctor] did any of your children have medical issues or siblings with medical problems ?
[patient] i do not have any siblings and , thankfully , my children are all healthy .
[doctor] wonderful . do you have any history of smoking , illicit drug use , heavy alcohol consumption ?
[patient] no drugs . i do drink socially , but never more than that . and i used to smoke , but really , everybody did back then and i probably quit about 30 years ago .
[doctor] excellent . i have that you're allergic to penicillin . any other allergies ?
[patient] nope , just penicillin .
[doctor] okay . i think that covers it . hop up here and let me take a look at you .
[doctor] okay , so let's use the normal new patient exam template . only change to make is the breast exam . there are no palpable masses , however , there is skin thickening at the medial inferior aspect of the right breast which may be radiation skin changes .
[doctor] in the result section , note that her ecog performance status today is zero .
[doctor] do you have ... did you have radiation after the lumpectomy ?
[patient] i did . we also talked about endocrine therapy , but i decided against that .
[doctor] okay . so your exam looks good , no masses , just some skin changes from that radiation . now , let's go over the plan for you .
[patient] okay , sounds good .
[doctor] as you know , you've had dcis which we'll list in my note as stage zero , er/pr positive , invasive ductal carcinoma of the right breast . your status post-lumpectomy with removal of five lymph nodes that were benign . you also had , um , radiation therapy but declined endocrine therapy . today's clinical examination shows no evidence of recurrence with the dcis or other malignancy and your mammogram in january , 2021 was also negative for recurrence and malignancy .
[doctor] so , based on all of that , we can just continue to observe you .
[patient] okay . that sounds great . and when do i come back in to see you ?
[doctor] in a year , but you should have another mammogram in april of 2022 before you come back to see me .
[patient] okay , i can do that .
[doctor] wonderful . i'm glad to see you doing so well . do you have any questions or concerns i can address for you today ?

MEDICAL NOTE:

CHIEF COMPLAINT

Right elbow pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Lawrence Butler is a pleasant 45-year-old male who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of right elbow pain.

Over the past week, the patient has developed 6/10 pain in the ""inside"" of his right elbow. The pain may radiate into his forearm on occasion, but does not extend up to his shoulder. He denies any history of trauma or injury, but he did start making pottery during the COVID-19 pandemic and suspects that his symptoms could be related to that. His symptoms affect his ability to lift objects or perform his typical activities of daily living. Ibuprofen provides minimal symptomatic relief.

SOCIAL HISTORY

The patient reports that he began making pottery during the COVID-19 pandemic.

MEDICATIONS

The patient reports that he has been taking ibuprofen.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Musculoskeletal: Reports right elbow pain.

VITALS

Normal

PHYSICAL EXAM

MSK: Examination of the right elbow: Moderate tenderness at the medial epicondyle. No pain with supination of the forearm. Pain with pronation of the forearm. Pain with resistance against flexion of the wrist.

RESULTS

X-ray imaging of the right elbow was obtained and reviewed in office today. These reveal no evidence of fracture or bony abnormality.

ASSESSMENT

Right medial epicondylitis.

PLAN

The patient and I discussed his diagnosis in detail, and I explained that his symptoms are likely caused by overuse and potential damage of the tendons. We will provide him with sling to be worn during the day while he is awake. I want him to take ibuprofen 600 mg every 6 hours with food for a full week and ice the elbow for 20 minutes, 3 times daily. Finally, I advised the patient to rest his elbow and avoid doing any pottery for the next couple of weeks.

INSTRUCTIONS

The patient will follow up in 1 week.

---------------------------------------------","[doctor] hey lawrence how're you doing
[patient] i'm doing alright aside from this elbow pain

[patient] you know it hurts a lot in the inside of my elbow
[doctor] okay so the inside of your right elbow okay
[patient] yeah
[doctor] and then does the pain radiate down your arm or up into your shoulder or anything like that
[patient] it does n't go into my shoulder it's it stays mostly at my elbow but it can go down a bit into my forearm
[doctor] okay and then do you remember any trauma did you hit your arm or elbow or any on anything

[doctor] okay and then and how long has this pain been going on
[patient] about four days now
[doctor] alright and anything you've done to help relieve or alleviate that pain any anything that that's giving you relief
[patient] i've tried ibuprofen that helps a little but not much
[doctor] okay so if it's okay with you i would like to do a a quick physical exam your vitals look good and i'm gon na do a focused exam on that right elbow i'm gon na go ahead and and and press here do you do you have any pain when i press here

[patient] yeah i've been taking tylenol i have had to try some ibuprofen i know you said to be careful with my blood pressure but i have been trying to do that because i'm just in so much pain and it's not really working
[doctor] okay and before what would you how long would you say it took you to pass the other stones or how was that that resolved
[patient] yeah usually usually about about three four days to pass it yeah
[doctor] right so this is this is the looks like this is the third day
[patient] yeah
[doctor] so we are getting close there
[patient] okay
[doctor] yeah so hopefully we can pass it but we'll i'll definitely we can take a look at it here in a second so while you are here i also wanted to check up on your your diabetes and and hypertension you have so i'm looking here at my notes and you're on two . five of norvasc for your high blood pressure when you came in today your blood pressure was a was a little bit high and i know that's probably because you are in a bunch of pain so that definitely makes sense but i think last time we talked a little bit about you getting a blood pressure cuff and taking your blood pressures regularly so those readings first off were you able to get the blood pressure cuff
[patient] i was i have n't been great about taking it but i did get the blood pressure cuff
[doctor] so the time that you did take it and i think that's something we got to work on is you've taken them i think at least three times a week i would like you to what have those been running
[patient] like the top numbers they're usually the one thirties sometimes i get i do go into one forties and once it went to like one fifty
[doctor] okay
[patient] and then the bottom number has been between seventy and eighty okay that i mean that's not too bad i think when you were first diagnosed you were up there in the
[doctor] the one eighties which was really high
[patient] right
[doctor] so let me talk a little bit also about you trying to lower your salt intake to like like twenty three hundred milligrams a a day so have you been able to do that
[patient] trying my best but doc i really like my french fries
[doctor] yeah
[patient] like
[doctor] we we all like we all like the french fries you know but you know we we we we also do n't like strokes so we do n't want to have a scope and all the all the french fries so that's something definitely i would like you to work on and do you think you'd be able to to curb that french fry habit or that bad this bad food habits by yourself or do you think you need help
[patient] yeah some help could be helpful okay yeah we can definitely get you connected with someone just to help you with your diet kinda that's the biggest thing for a lot of my patient is trying to control that diet alright
[doctor] so i also want to take a look here at your diabetes and last time you came in your a1c was a little bit higher at seven . three and you're on five hundred of metformin currently so have you been taking your blood sugars before you eat everyday
[patient] i have and those those have been pretty good they are like in the low one hundreds
[doctor] okay that that that's definitely good because when you came in i think we did a glucose test on you couple of months ago and you were around three hundred which is which is pretty up there so i'm glad that you know those levels are down and have you been taking that metformin everyday
[patient] i do
[doctor] okay
[patient] i do take it
[doctor] that that that that's really good alright so let me do a quick physical exam on you just a couple of questions before i take a look at your your abdomen and and your back talked to take a look at that that kidney stones you're having so i just want to make sure are you having any any chest pain
[patient] no chest pain
[doctor] no chest pain are you having any belly pain
[patient] the back pain is starting to kind of go down into my groin but i would n't say any back pain i mean abdominal pain
[doctor] no abdominal pain alright so let me check here i'm gon na listen to your heart real quick and so on your heart exam i do hear a grade two out of six systolic ejection murmur and that we knew about that already so not really worried about that currently listen to your lungs your lungs are clear bilaterally i do n't hear any crackles or wheezes so let me press here on your abdomen does that hurt
[patient] yes
[doctor] okay i'm gon na press here on your back is that painful
[patient] yes
[doctor] alright so on your examination of your abdomen there is tenderness to palpation of the abdomen there is n't any rebound or guarding though and only there is also cva tinnitus on the right on your on your flank as well and so it seems to me you know that you do have that kidney stone looks like you do have some inflammation around your kidney that's what that that's that tenderness around your cva is is telling me so let's go talk a little bit about my assessment and plan for you so you know right now because of your history of of having kidney stones you you do have a kidney stone so what we're gon na do is first off i'm gon na get you some pain medication kinda you're in a ton of pain right now i'm gon na prescribe you some oxycodone five milligrams you can take that every six to eight hours as needed for pain and so hopefully that can help you feeling better and you can continue to take that tylenol for any breakthrough pain that you're having i do wan na make sure that you're pushing fluids right now because we need to try to push that stone out that you're having just kinda clear your kidneys and that that would definitely help i also want to give you a strainer so you can strain your urine to see if you do actually pass that stone and then i'm going to refer you to urology and we're actually i'm gon na have you you even if you pass a stone in the next couple of days i want you to go anyway because it seems like you're having recurrent kidney stones and so hopefully they can help do something to to help this from happening in the future for your hypertension i'm gon na keep you on that two . five norvasc your your blood pressures look good so i'm not gon na make any changes there and then for your diabetes we'll keep you on the five hundred of metformin and i also want to give you a referral to nutrition to a dietitian and they will be able to help you with your your diet i know you said you have a few issues so you know they can possibly write a diet for you and if you follow it you know hopefully in the future we can get you off of both of these medications and get you back to normal so how does that all sound
[patient] that sounds good and i i just i just want this pain to go away so thank you

MEDICAL NOTE:

CHIEF COMPLAINT

Iron deficiency anemia.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Mrs. Christina Cooper is a 65-year-old female who presents with a long-history of iron deficiency anemia.

The patient reports she has been living with anemia since she was 13 years old. She attempted to donate blood on 12/2019 but was unable to due to her anemia. She has a history of heavy menstruation and a hysterectomy in 1996. She completed a colonoscopy 5-6 years ago with nonsignificant findings. She denies having a pacemaker, defibrillator, sleep apnea, or using oxygen.

Mrs. Cooper reports a myriad of symptoms, stating she feels fatigued often during the day, feverish with chills at times, and during activity feels she cannot catch her breath and some wheezing is present. She has been having some headaches which is uncommon for her. Additionally, she is noticing tingling sensations, cold sensitivity, and her anxiety and depression have worsened.

PAST HISTORY

Surgical
Hysterectomy, 1996.

Procedures
Colonoscopy 5-6 years ago.

SOCIAL HISTORY

Drink’s alcohol 1-2 times per year.

CURRENT MEDICATIONS

Ferrous Sulfate 25 mg tablet twice per day (1 in the morning, 1 in the evening), Vitamin B12 OTC.

PHYSICAL EXAM

Gastrointestinal
Abdomen non-tender.

ASSESSMENT

• Iron deficiency anemia

Mrs. Cooper is a 65-year-old female who was diagnosed with iron deficiency anemia in 12/2019 and was unable to donate blood. Her follow-up blood work in 01/2020 revealed a low hemoglobin, stable hematocrit, and normal iron labs, although, ferritin was low. She has been taking ferrous sulfate 325 mg by mouth.

PLAN

I have asked her to continue each ferrous sulfate dose with vitamin C found in orange juice for the next 12 weeks then recheck CBC, iron ferritin, B-12, and folate. A referral was sent for her to see a hematologist. We will plan for EGD and colonoscopy to assess for potential sources of anemia or GI bleed. If this is inconclusive, capsule endoscopy can be considered.

INSTRUCTIONS

Schedule upper endoscopy, colonoscopy and appointment with hematologist. Return to the clinic if symptoms worsen.

---------------------------------------------","[doctor] today i'm seeing christina cooper . her date of birth is 07/01/1954 . uh , ms. cooper is a new patient who was referred by diane nelson for a long-standing iron deficiency anemia .
[doctor] hello , how are you ?
[patient] i'm good , thank you .
[doctor] so tell me what brings you in today .
[patient] recently i tried to donate blood , around december i think , and they told me i was anemic , which is something i've been dealing with for a while , so it's not the first time i've been told i'm anemic .
[doctor] or how have you been feeling in general with this ?
[patient] not great . i have been feeling fatigued often during the day , and even feverish with chills at times . when i try to be active i like i ca n't catch my breath and i feel like i'm wheezing . i've had some headaches too , which is not like me .
[doctor] okay . are there any other symptoms ?
[patient] i've been noting some chilling sensations . i also get cold so easily . it's annoying . i feel like i have to really bundle up . i do n't know if this is related but my anxiety and depression feel like it has been getting worse lately . i feel like a mess .
[doctor] sounds like you're not feeling great , obviously . and i'm glad you came to see us . um , we're certainly going to try to figure this out and figure out what's going on , uh , but it sounds like you've been dealing with this anemia for a long time ?
[patient] yeah , i've been anemic since i was 13 years old .
[doctor] right . so why do your doctors think you're anemic ? do you have a history of heavy periods ?
[patient] well i did have heavy periods until i had a hysterectomy in 1996 . but no , they have not told me why they think i'm anemic , which is frustrating honestly .
[doctor] yeah . i can imagine that is . um , let's see if we can help though . since you had your hysterectomy your periods , of course , are no longer the issue . um , when was your last colonoscopy ?
[patient] about five to six years ago .
[doctor] and was it relatively a normal exam ? did you have any polyps ?
[patient] no . they said they'd see me in 10 years .
[doctor] well that's good news .
[patient] yeah , i agree .
[doctor] um , do you have a pacemaker or defibrillator , or have sleep apnea , or use oxygen at night ?
[patient] no .
[doctor] all right . do you ever drink alcohol ?
[patient] yeah , but only once or twice a year .
[doctor] okay . are you taking any supplements such as iron or vitamin b12 ?
[patient] i already started taking my iron pills which i have not taken in about a year .
[doctor] all right . and what are you taking ?
[patient] i'm taking 25 milligram tablets , twice daily .
[doctor] okay , and that's the , the ferrous sulfate ?
[patient] yeah , that's it . i take one in the morning and one in the evening .
[doctor] okay . anything else ?
[patient] yeah , i take vitamin b12 , just the over the counter stuff .
[doctor] okay , very good . all right , well let's go ahead and take a look and see what's going on .
[patient] sounds good . thank you .
[doctor] of course . you'll hear me , uh , talk through your exam so that i get all the information documented .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] all right . so use my general physical exam template . i will start by listening to your heart and lungs .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] all right . next , i'd like you to lay back so i can examine your abdomen .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] is there any tenderness where i'm pressing ?
[patient] no .
[doctor] okay . you can sit up . so your physical exam is normal without any significant findings . all right ms. cooper , often when we initially see anemia and your host of symptoms , we suspect internal bleeding .
[patient] is that why they want me to have another upper endoscopy ?
[doctor] actually it would be an upper endoscopy and a colonoscopy , but yes , likely that's the reason why .
[patient] lovely .
[doctor] yeah . unfortunately our cameras do not meet all the way in the middle , so if those tests back , come , if those tests come back fine , then we'll have you swallow a pill camera to take pictures as it moves through your , uh , system .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] we may not need to , but it's just the first thing we can do to make sure that you're not losing blood . um , the second thing we can do is have you see a hematologist . they will tell us if you need to give any , to give you any intravenous iron , or maybe something to help your body store the iron better .
[patient] all right .
[doctor] so let's go ahead , get your upper endoscopy and colonoscopy scheduled .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] um , have you ever had any issue with sedation in the past ?
[patient] no , i was just sleepy afterwards .
[doctor] okay . well we will give you a bowel prep to clean out your bowels ahead of time . um , if we do these tests and they are normal , like i said , then we will consider that capsule endoscopy .
[patient] okay . sounds like a plan .
[doctor] all right . so after that you'll be all done and we will send you to the hematologist . additionally , i'm going to need you to start taking your iron pills with orange juice . uh , the vitamin c will help you absorb the iron better . do this for about 8-12 weeks , uh , and then we can reassess your blood work .
[patient] okay , that sounds great .
[doctor] all right . well i think we have our plan . on your way out , stop by and schedule your upper endoscopy and c- colonoscopy . uh , we will send a referral to dr. flores who is is the hematologist , so schedule that appointment . um , here are your instructions for the pre- uh , the bowel prep . uh , call us if you have any questions or worsening symptoms . we'll be happy to help you .
[patient] thank you .
[doctor] you're welcome . have a great day , have a great day ms. cooper .
[patient] you too .
[doctor] all right . this is christina cooper , pleasant 65 year old female who was diagnosed with iron deficiency anemia in 12-2019 , and w- and was unable to donate blood . um , her followup blood work on 01/20/20 was revealed a low hemoglobin , stable hematocrit and normal iron labs , although ferritin was low . um , she was taking ferrous sulfate , three hundred , twenty phil- 25 milligrams by mouth . i've asked her to continue each dose with vitamin c found in orange juice , for the next 12 weeks , then recheck to the cbc , iron , ferritin , b12 , and folate . um , a referral was sent to her hematologist . we will plan for an egd and a colonoscopy to assess for potential sources of anemia or gi bleed . if this is inconclusive , capsule endoscopy will be considered . thanks .",2609.5,"Ferrous Sulfate 25 mg tablet twice per day (1 in the morning, 1 in the evening), Vitamin B12 OTC.",gpt4_result,The patient is currently taking ferrous sulfate 25 milligram tablets twice daily and over-the-counter vitamin B12.,0.6,Bin 1

MEDICAL NOTE:

CHIEF COMPLAINT

Tick bite.

MEDICAL HISTORY

Patient reports a history of arthritis, hypertension, and diabetes type 2.

SOCIAL HISTORY

Patient reports he enjoys spending time outside in the woods and working in the yard. He went hunting with his grandchildren a couple of weeks ago.

MEDICATIONS

Patient reports taking lisinopril 20 mg once a day and metformin 1000 mg twice daily most of the time.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Constitutional: Reports general ill feelings. Denies any fever, chills, flu like symptoms, body aches, or trouble waking.
Respiratory: Denies cough or shortness of breath.
Musculoskeletal: Denies joint pain or problems with ambulation.
Skin: Reports warmth on the right knee.
Neurological: Reports headache. Denies dizziness.

VITALS

Blood Pressure: 122/70 mmHg.
Heart Rate: 67 beats per minute.
Body Temperature: 98.4 degrees F.

PHYSICAL EXAM

Neck
- General Examination: Neck is supple without thyromegaly or lymphadenopathy.

Respiratory
- Auscultation of Lungs: Clear bilaterally.

Cardiovascular
- Auscultation of Heart: Regular rate and rhythm. No murmurs, gallops or rubs.

Musculoskeletal
- Examination of the right knee: Erythema and edema as well as an area of fluctuance noted over the right patella. There is pain to palpation of the right anterior knee. Full range of motion.

Integumentary
- Examination: There is evidence of a bull’s eye rash over the right knee.

RESULTS

Patient's previous kidney function is within normal limits.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

1. Tick bite.
- Medical Reasoning: My concern is that he might have Lyme disease based on the presentation of his right knee.
- Patient Education and Counseling: The patient and I discussed blood testing to determine if he does in fact have Lyme disease. I explained that Lyme disease can cause problems with other organs if not treated appropriately. We discussed that sometimes antibiotics need to be administered intravenously if oral antibiotics are not given early enough. We will see how he does with a course of oral antibiotics as I would like to avoid intravenous antibiotics.
- Medical Treatment: Prescription for doxycycline 100 mg twice a day for 3 weeks provided. Lyme titer and Western blot will be obtained to determine if he has Lyme disease.

2. Hypertension.
- Medical Reasoning: This is well-controlled at this time.
- Patient Education and Counseling: The patient and I discussed that he is doing really well monitoring his blood pressure at home.
- Medical Treatment: Continue lisinopril 20 mg once a day. Lipid panel ordered to assess his cholesterol levels.

3. Diabetes type 2.
- Medical Reasoning: He is doing a good job managing his diabetes since his blood sugars are running in the 120s. I do not think we need to make any adjustments, but we will see what the hemoglobin A1c shows as that gives us an idea of what his blood sugars are doing on a long-term basis.
- Patient Education and Counseling: We discussed that metformin can affect kidney function; however, his kidney function was last checked 2 months ago, and it has remained within normal limits.
- Medical Treatment: Continue metformin 1000 mg twice a day. Hemoglobin A1c ordered. Basic metabolic panel ordered to assess kidney function. 

Patient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.

[patient] it's a little bit sore
[doctor] okay there is pain to palpation of the right anterior knee and i'm just gon na bend your knee up and down does that hurt at all
[patient] no no it's just more of the typical grinding that i would feel
[doctor] okay there is full range of motion of the right knee and on skin examination there is evidence of a bull's-eye rash over the right knee okay so what does that mean richard so that means that you know you do have some area of some inflammation over the over the right knee where you where you have that tick bite and you do have what we call that bull's eye rash which is what we get concerned about with with lyme disease so let's just talk a little bit about you know my assessment and my plan for you okay so for this first problem of your of your tick bite my concern is that you might have lyme disease based on the presentation of your right knee so i'm gon na go ahead and start you on doxycycline one hundred milligrams twice a day
[patient] we're gon na continue that for about three weeks i'm also gon na go ahead and send a lyme titer as well as a western blot to see if you do in fact have lyme lyme disease and we'll have to go ahead and just see how you do with this we you know i'd like to avoid intravenous antibiotics which i think we can avoid but i wanted to see how you do so
[doctor] do you have any questions about that
[patient] yeah i did n't know what those last two things or just
[doctor] yeah so so we are gon na start you on some antibiotics to help help you with this
[patient] you know possible lyme disease and i'm gon na just order some blood tests just to see exactly what's going on and then you know sometimes people need intravenous antibiotics because lyme disease can cause problems on other organs like your heart that type of thing
[doctor] if not treated appropriately and sometimes we need to give antibiotics through the iv which i'd like to avoid i think that we got this early enough that we can just treat you with some oral antibiotics okay for your second problem of your hypertension you know i think you're doing a really good job let's go ahead and continue you on the lisinopril twenty milligrams once a day and i wan na just go ahead and order a lipid panel just to make sure that everything is okay with your cholesterol how does that sound
[patient] that's fine
[doctor] great and then for your third problem of your diabetes i wan na just go ahead and order a hemoglobin a1c and continue you on the metformin one thousand milligrams twice a day it sounds like you're doing a good job since your blood sugars are running in the one twenties i do n't think we need to make any adjustments but we'll see what the hemoglobin a1c shows that gives us a an idea of what your blood sugars are doing on a long-term basis how does that sound
[patient] okay at what point time do you start kinda checking kidney function i've been told that metformin can possibly cause some kidney issues
[doctor] so it can you know your kidney function we've you know i think you've been really lucky it's been normal i checked it about two months ago and it looks pretty good it looks pretty normal but since we're doing blood work on you i can go ahead and order a a basic metabolic panel just to make sure that your kidney function is stable
[patient] okay that'd be good
[doctor] okay anything else
[patient] not that i can think of at this time as soon as i leave
[doctor] well you know where to find me okay
[patient] alright

MEDICAL NOTE:

CHIEF COMPLAINT

Right-sided abdominal pain

MEDICAL HISTORY

Patient reports history of kidney stones.

FAMILY HISTORY

Patient reports his father has a history of kidney stones.

MEDICATIONS

Patient reports use of Tylenol.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Gastrointestinal: Reports right-sided abdominal pain and nausea. Denies vomiting
Genitourinary: Reports dysuria and dark colored urine. Denies hematuria.

PHYSICAL EXAM

Gastrointestinal
- Examination of Abdomen: No masses or tenderness to palpation. No rebound or guarding. No peritoneal signs. Positive CVA tenderness on the right flank.

RESULTS

Previous CT scan of the abdomen ordered by the patient's PCP is reviewed and demonstrates a 0.5 cm kidney stone located in the proximal right ureter. There is no evidence of hydronephrosis.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

1. Acute nephrolithiasis.
- Medical Reasoning: The patient presents with complaints of right-sided abdominal pain. His previous CT scan was reviewed and demonstrates a 0.5 cm kidney stone located in the proximal right ureter without evidence of hydronephrosis.
- Medical Treatment: I have recommended that he push fluids in order to help facilitate urination to help pass the stone. He will be provided with a strainer to allow us to potentially test the stone if he is able to pass it. I have also prescribed oxycodone 5 mg every 6 to 8 hours as needed for pain. He can continue to alternate oxycodone with Tylenol. A basic metabolic panel, urinalysis, and urine culture will also be ordered.

INSTRUCTIONS

He will follow up in 1 to 2 weeks. If he is still having symptoms at that time, we will discuss further treatment such as lithotripsy or ureteroscopy. He is to contact me if he is having worsening symptoms over the next week.

[doctor] i saw my doctor and they ordered a cat scan and said i had a kidney stone and sent me to see a urologist okay well does the pain move or or or go anywhere or does it stay right in that same spot yeah it feels like it goes to my lower abdomen in into my groin okay and is the pain constant or does it come and go it comes and goes when it comes it's it's pretty it's pretty bad i feel like i ca n't find a comfortable position okay and do you notice any any pain when you urinate or when you pee
[patient] yeah it kinda burns a little bit
[doctor] okay do you notice any blood i do n't think there is any you know frank blood but the urine looks a little dark sometimes okay and what have you taken for the pain i have taken some tylenol but it has n't really helped okay and do you have any nausea vomiting any fever chills i feel nauseated but i'm not vomiting okay is anyone in your in your family had kidney stones yes my father had them and have you had kidney stones before yeah so i i've i've had them but i've been able to pass them but this is taking a lot longer okay well i'm just gon na go ahead and do a physical examination i'm gon na be calling out some of my exam findings and i'm going to explain what what those mean when i'm done okay
[patient] okay
[doctor] okay so on physical examination of the abdomen on a abdominal exam there is no tenderness to palpation there is no evidence of any rebound or guarding there is no peritoneal signs there is positive cva tenderness on the right flank so essentially what that means russell is that you know you have some tenderness over your over your right kidney and that just means that you might have some inflammation there so i i reviewed the results of the ct scan of your abdomen that the primary care doctor ordered and it does show a . five centimeter kidney stone located in the proximal right ureter so this the ureter is the duct in which urine passes between the kidney and the bladder there's no evidence of what we call hydronephrosis this means you know swelling of the kidney which is good means that things are still able to get through so let's talk a little bit about my assessment and my plan okay so for your first problem of this acute nephrolithiasis or kidney stone i i wan na go ahead and recommend that you push fluids to help facilitate urination and peeing to help pass the stone i'm going to prescribe oxycodone five milligrams every six to eight hours as needed for pain you can continue to alternate that with some tylenol i'm going to give you a strainer that you can use to strain your urine so that we can see it see the stone when it passes and we can send it for some some tests if that happens i'm also gon na order what we call a basic metabolic panel a urinalysis and a urine culture now i wan na see you again in one to two weeks and if you're still having symptoms we'll have to discuss further treatment such as lithotripsy which is essentially a shock wave procedure in which we sedate you and use shock waves to break up the stone to help it pass we could also do what we call a ureteroscopy which is a small telescope small camera used to go up to to the urethra and bladder and up into the ureter to retrieve the stone so let's see how you do over the next week and i want you to contact me if you're having worsening symptoms okay okay sounds good thank you",911.0,Patient reports use of Tylenol.,gpt4_result,The patient has taken some Tylenol for the pain.,1.0,Bin 1

MEDICAL NOTE:

CHIEF COMPLAINT

Left knee pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Andrea Barnes is a 34-year-old female who presents today for evaluation of left knee pain.

The patient has been experiencing intermittent episodes of pain and sudden instability with ambulation. Her pain is localized deep in her patella and occurs less than once daily. Due to the fleeting nature of these episodes, she has not taken medication and simply braces herself until it passes. She denies any trauma or injury, or ever hearing or feeling a pop in the knee. Her symptoms do not interfere with her daily activities and she does not use a cane.

Regarding her hypertension, it has been several days since she last checked her blood pressure at home, but it was approximately 120/70 mmHg at that time. Her current medications include amlodipine, lisinopril, and hydrochlorothiazide, all of which she takes on a regular basis.

In terms of her diabetes, her fasting morning blood glucose levels have been approximately 130 based on home monitoring. This is slightly higher than usual, even though she has been compliant with metformin and Farxiga. She does try to avoid eating late at night.

MEDICAL HISTORY

Patient reports a personal history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes.

SOCIAL HISTORY

Patient likes to travel and is planning a trip to Columbus, Georgia in the next month or so. She is part of the Lion's Club.

MEDICATIONS

Patient reports that she is taking amlodipine, lisinopril 20 mg once daily, hydrochlorothiazide, Metformin, and Farxiga.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Musculoskeletal: Reports left knee pain and instability,

VITALS

Temperature: 98.2 degrees F
Heart rate: 72 bpm
Respirations: 16
Blood pressure: 122/70 mmHg

PHYSICAL EXAM

MSK: Examination of the right knee: No ecchymosis or edema. No effusion. No pain with palpation.
Examination of the left knee: Full range of motion. Negative varus and valgus stress test.

RESULTS

X-rays were obtained and reviewed today. These reveal no evidence of fracture or bony abnormality.

ASSESSMENT

1. Left knee pain.
2. Hypertension.
3. Diabetes mellitus type 2.

PLAN

After reviewing the patients x-rays, I believe there is some arthritis in the knee. I'm going to prescribe meloxicam 15 mg once daily. We can consider physical therapy to strengthen the muscles around the area to prevent any further issues.

Her hypertension is well controlled with her current medication regimen. She can continue with lisinopril 20 mg once daily. I'm also going to order an echocardiogram for further evaluation of the murmur heard on exam.

She has been compliant with metformin as prescribed, but her blood glucose levels have been slightly elevated recently. I'm going to order a lipid panel, as well as a hemoglobin A1c to determine if any adjustments need to be made to her dose of metformin.

---------------------------------------------","[doctor] okay hi andrea well i
[patient] hello
[doctor] i understand you're you've come in with some right knee pain can you tell me about it what's going on

[doctor] and are you taking your metformin
[patient] yes yes that's along with the blood pressure medicine morning and night
[doctor] okay alright so are you are you eating like late at night or anything like that

[patient] okay
[doctor] for the diabetes mellitus i wan na order a hemoglobin a1c to see if we need to make any adjustments to your metformin and i'm also gon na order a lipid panel okay do you have any questions

[doctor] okay .
[patient] right here .
[doctor] all right . and anything make it better or worse ?
[patient] i have been putting ice on it , uh , and i've been taking ibuprofen , but it does n't seem to help much .
[doctor] okay . so it sounds like you fell a couple days ago , and you've hurt something inside of your right knee .
[patient] mm-hmm .
[doctor] and you've been taking a little bit of ice , uh , putting some ice on it , and has n't really helped and some ibuprofen . is that right ?
[patient] that's right . yeah .
[doctor] okay , let's review your past history for a second . it looks like , uh , do you have any other past medical history ?

[doctor] okay , all right . how about any surgeries in the past ?
[patient] i have had a nose job .
[doctor] all right . um , let's do your exam , okay ? so is it tender ... where is it mostly tender right now ?
[patient] right on the inside of my knee . right here .
[doctor] all right , so if i bend your knee forward , does that seem to hurt ?
[patient] yes , that hurts .
[doctor] all right , how about if i twist it a little bit that way .
[patient] that hurts a lot .
[doctor] okay , okay . and how about down here ? do you feel me touch you down here ?
[patient] yes .
[doctor] all right . any other pain down here in your calves ?
[patient] no .
[doctor] no , okay . so on exam you do have some tenderness over the medial portion of your knee over the medial meniscus area . uh , there is no , uh , there is a little bit of tenderness when i flex your , uh , when i , uh , uh , do some valgus stressing on your , on your leg . um , you have normal sensation . so let's take a look at your x-rays .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] okay . hey dragon , show me the x-rays . so looking at the x-ray , um , of your left knee , uh , it appears to be there's no fractures there right now . i do n't see any , uh , there's a little bit of , uh , fluid , uh , but there is no , uh , there's no , um , fracture or there's no dislocation . everything else seems to be lined up properly , okay ?
[patient] okay .
[doctor] so in summary after my exam , uh , looking at your knee , uh , on the x-ray and your exam , you have some tenderness over the medial meniscus , so i think you have probably an acute medial meniscus sprain right now or strain . uh , at this point , my recommendation would be to put you in a knee brace , uh , and we'll go ahead and have you use some crutches temporarily for the next couple days . we'll have you come back in about a week and see how you're doing , and if it's not better , we'll get an mri at that time .

CHIEF COMPLAINT

Left foot pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Jean Martinez is a pleasant 27-year-old female who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of left foot pain.

The patient sustained an injury to her left foot while playing soccer yesterday. She became entangled with another player, causing the player to fall onto the patient's foot, resulting in immediate pain. After the incident, she required help to get off of the field and was unable to participate for the rest of the game. Her trainer wrapped her foot, and she has tried ice, elevation, and ibuprofen to treat her symptoms. with medication, she rates her pain as 3/10, but without medication her pain is rated as 7-8/10. There is no numbness, tingling, or other abnormal sensations associated with her pain.

Of note, the patient has sustained several injuries in the past while playing soccer, but this is her first left foot injury.

MEDICAL HISTORY

The patient reports that she has sustained several soccer injuries in the past.

SOCIAL HISTORY

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Musculoskeletal: Reports left foot pain.
Neurological: Denies left foot numbness or tingling.

VITALS

Blood pressure: 118/72 mmHg
Heart rate: 58 bpm
Respiratory rate: 14
Temperature: Afebrile
Oxygen saturation: 99% on room air

PHYSICAL EXAM

CV: Regular rate and rhythm without clicks, rubs, or murmurs. No ectopic beats noted on auscultation of the heart. Brisk capillary refill, less than 3 seconds. Dorsalis pedis pulse is intact and strong.
RESPIRATORY: Lungs are clear and equal bilaterally.
NEURO: Motor and sensation in the left foot are intact to light touch.
MSK: Examination of the left foot: Ecchymosis on the plantar and dorsal aspects of the foot. Associated swelling. Tenderness to palpation of the midfoot. Positive piano key test.

RESULTS

X-ray images of the left foot were obtained and reviewed today. These reveal subtle dorsal displacement of the base of the 2nd metatarsal with a 3 mm separation of the 1st and 2nd metatarsal bases. There is presence of a bony fragment in the Lisfranc joint space.

ASSESSMENT

Lisfranc fracture, left foot.

PLAN

I explained the nature of her injury in detail. Based on her exam and x-ray findings, she will most likely require surgery of the left foot, but I want to order an MRI to assess for any ligamentous injuries. We discussed the procedure and postoperative expectations, such as recovery time and restrictions, at length. We also discussed the complications associated with deferring surgical intervention including poor bone and ligament healing, pes planus deformation, and a high likelihood of developing arthritis in the foot. She will be unable to participate for the remainder of the soccer season, but should be able to play next season.

INSTRUCTIONS

We will see the patient on Monday, for surgery.

---------------------------------------------","[doctor] hey jean how're you doing today
[patient] i'm doing alright aside from this foot pain that i have
[doctor] so i see here that you looks like you hurt your left foot here where you were playing soccer can you tell me a little bit more about what happened
[patient] yeah so yeah i was playing in a soccer game yesterday and i was trying to steal the ball from another player and she ended up falling directly onto my right foot and i do n't know i i mean i was trying to get around her and my body ended up twisting around her and then i accidentally felt a pain in my foot
[doctor] okay so have you ever hurt your left foot before
[patient] no i've had a lot of injuries in soccer but never injured this foot
[doctor] okay and then so after the fall and the entanglement with the other player were you able to continue playing
[patient] no i had to stop playing right away and actually being helped off the field
[doctor] wow okay and what have you been doing for the the pain since then
[patient] so i've been keeping it elevated icing it the trainer wrapped it yesterday and taking ibuprofen as well
[doctor] okay alright so without any ibuprofen can you tell me what your pain level is
[patient] without ibuprofen i would say my pain is a three
[doctor] okay and then with your ibuprofen can you tell me what your pain level is
[patient] like a seven eight
[doctor] okay so how long have you been playing soccer
[patient] really since i was like four five i've been playing a long time
[doctor] well that's cool yeah we our our youngest daughter she is almost sixteen and she plays the inner marrial soccer league they are down at the rex center did is that where you started playing or did you guys did you start playing somewhere else
[patient] yeah just like this local town leak i started playing that way and then played all throughout school
[doctor] that's
[patient] high school teams
[doctor] that's awesome so just out of curiosity with the left foot have you experienced anything like numbness or tingling or or any strange sensation
[patient] no i have not
[doctor] okay now if it's okay with you i would like to do a quick physical exam i reviewed your vitals and everything looks good blood pressure was one eighteen over seventy two heart rate was fifty eight respiratory rate was fourteen you are afebrile and you had an o2 saturation of ninety nine percent on room air on your heart exam your regular of rate and rhythm do n't appreciate any clicks rubs or murmurs no ectopic beats noted there on auscultation listening to your lungs lungs are clear and equal bilaterally so you're moving good air i'd like to do a focused foot exam on your left foot so i do see some bruising on the bottom of your foot and on the top of your foot as well now there is associated swelling and i do appreciate tenderness to palpation of your midfoot and you are positive for the piano key test on a neurovascular exam of your left foot you have a brisk capillary refill of less than three seconds dorsalis pedis pulse is intact and strong and you do have motor and sensation that it's intact to light touch now i would like to do a review of the diagnostic imaging that you had before you came in so i do notice a subtle dorsal displacement of the base of the second metatarsal with a three millimeter separation of the first and second metatarsal bases and the presence of a bony fragment in the lisfranc joint space so lem me talk to you a little bit about my assessment and plan now for for the first concern of right foot pain your right foot pain is due to a lisfranc fracture which is a fracture to one of your second metatarsal bones at the top of your foot where the metatarsals meet your cuboids now there are ligaments at the top of your foot so i'm gon na be ordering an mri to assess for injury to any of these ligaments now based on your exam and from what i'm seeing on your x-ray you're most likely going to need surgery of that foot now the surgery will place the bones back in their proper position and using plates and screws will hold them there while they heal and this is gon na allow those bones and ligaments to heal properly it is a day surgery and you will be able to go home the same day and then i'm going to have you follow up with me here in the clinic you'll be in a cast and you will need to use crutches and you will not be able to use that left foot for about six to eight weeks now after that six to eight weeks you will gradually start walking on your foot based on how you tolerate it and we'll see how you do at that point so i do believe you're gon na need surgery i i'm recommending this because there are significant complications to your foot if we do not do this poor bone and ligament healing can lead to losing the arch of your foot and you're becoming flat-footed you also have a high likelihood of developing arthritis in that foot so what i'm gon na do unfortunately you'll be out the rest of the season but we are gon na get you fixed up and ready for next season if you're okay with all of this i'm gon na have the nurse come in and get you started on your paperwork and then i will see you on monday morning and we will get your foot taken care of

MEDICAL NOTE:

CHIEF COMPLAINT

Bilateral elbow pain, right worse than left.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Dylan Bennett is a pleasant 53-year-old male who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of bilateral elbow pain, right worse than left.

The patient has been experiencing bilateral elbow pain, right worse than left, for approximately 1.5 years. His pain is localized to the medial aspect of his elbows and is described as being extremely sore, worse with increased use of his upper extremities. Of note, he utilizes heavy weights for strength training and was very active in sports when he was younger, primarily playing basketball, baseball, and football, but he denies having any pain at that time. Applying ice to the area has not been helpful, but he does use ibuprofen 800 mg 3 times daily.

SOCIAL HISTORY

The patient reports that utilizes heavy weights for strength training. He was also very active in sports when he was younger, primarily playing basketball, baseball, and football.

He is expecting a newborn baby in the near future.

MEDICATIONS

The patient reports that he has been taking ibuprofen 800 mg 3 times daily.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Musculoskeletal: Reports bilateral elbow pain, right worse than left.

PHYSICAL EXAM

CV: Pulses are equal in all extremities.
NEURO: Sensation is normal to light touch distally.
MSK: 
Examination of the right elbow: Limited range of motion with extension with pain. Full range of motion with flexion with pain. Pain to palpation along the medial aspect. No pain to palpation on the lateral aspect of the elbow. Pain with supination. No pain with pronation.
Examination of the left elbow: minimal pain with flexion and extension Slight Limited ROM on extension of the arm. Pain with supination. No pain with pronation.

RESULTS

X-ray images of the bilateral elbows were obtained and review in office today. These reveal no evidence of fracture or bony misalignment.

ASSESSMENT

Bilateral medial epicondylitis.

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, we had a lengthy discussion in regards to his current symptoms. I want to get an MRI of the bilateral elbows for further evaluation. We discussed the possibility of performing a whole blood transfusion to encourage healing, and the patient is already familiar with this procedure.

---------------------------------------------","[doctor] hey dylan what's going on so i lift quite a bit of weights i try to stay in shape as much as i can i'm not like normal people i lift heavy weights and my elbow is extremely sore which elbow is it

[doctor] pain with supination no pain with pronation
[patient] correct
[doctor] alright so dylan it took some x-rays coming in looks like you do n't have any any fractures or any bony misalignment which i expect with this kind of injury i do think that what you have is medial epicondylitis which is
[patient] is that golfer's elbow
[doctor] yes same thing have you been golfing a lot
[patient] well not in the past year and a half i've had this for a long time
[doctor] okay also known as pictures elbow

[patient] thank god
[doctor] yeah and once you get the mri i'll know a little bit more what i'd like to do is something called a whole blood transfusion have you heard of that before
[patient] no please tell me remind me
[doctor] yeah it should help with the healing of your elbow it's just a procedure we'll stick a needle in your elbow
[patient] you do a stick needle in my elbow
[doctor] mm-hmm and help with some of the healing of your elbow
[patient] so it's kinda like dry needling then
[doctor] no
[patient] not at all
[doctor] what is it
[patient] is it is that that thing where like you take the blood out of like say my my thigh
[doctor] mm-hmm
[patient] and then you literally inject it into my tendon
[doctor] yes
[patient] that it activates the healing
[doctor] yeah that's exactly what it is
[patient] interesting cool
[doctor] yeah
[patient] maybe i have heard about that
[doctor] we've we've had some really good responses from other patients on it so hopefully i mean that should be a good solution for you since you've been having issues with this
[patient] i'm excited
[doctor] yeah and we can hopefully get you scheduled for that in the next couple of weeks it's not not a major procedure and you should heal in the next two weeks so that wo n't be a problem especially considering that you're expecting a newborn soon we want to make sure you're all healed for that
[patient] wow i did n't even say that

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

1. Congestive heart failure.
- Medical Reasoning: This appears to have been caused by dietary indiscretion and uncontrolled hypertension.
- Patient Education and Counseling: I encouraged the patient to continue making dietary modifications, including limiting her sodium intake.

I also advised her to monitor her weight daily and contact me if she gains 3 pounds in 2 days.
- Medical Treatment: Continue with Bumex 2 mg once daily. Referral placed for consult with a nutritionist for education and recommendations regarding her diet.

2. Hypertension.
- Medical Reasoning: This has been poorly controlled due to inconsistent compliance with medication and dietary indiscretion.
- Patient Education and Counseling: We discussed dietary modifications as noted above.
- Medical Treatment: She can continue on Cozaar 100 mg daily and Norvasc 5 mg once daily. Renal artery ultrasound ordered to rule out any issues such as renal artery stenosis.

MEDICAL NOTE:

CHIEF COMPLAINT

Follow-up bilateral breast cysts.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Donna Torres is a 40-year-old female who presents for follow-up surveillance of bilateral breast cysts.

The patient reports continual presence of “lumps” in bilateral breasts with some soreness. She is being seen today for surveillance of the cysts. The patient is taking progesterone, which was initially prescribed to support normalization of menstruation, which was effective. She is also still using vaginal cream one time per week which has improved symptoms of itching and discomfort.

Her last pap smear was in 2019, with negative/negative results. She did have an abnormal pap smear in 2009, which resulted in repeat pap smears per 6 months until her results normalized.

Mrs. Torres experienced increased anxiety in 11/2021 and 12/2021, stating “it was brutal” and felt she could not manage her symptoms and sought treatment. Dr. Brown started the patient on Buspar, which has successfully controlled her anxiety. The patient relates her anxiety to work related stress and possibly aging. Her work involves supporting Covid evaluation centers and clinics. She confirms receiving both Covid vaccinations. Initially, she was experiencing spikes in anxiety prior to menstruation, but her anxiety then became more random with an unclear cause. To note, the patient was started on Singulair, which the patient was told could also cause anxiety.

The patient discontinued Camila birth control, which did result in a significant increase in appetite. This has resolved and she reports she has lost weight in the past 6 months.

---------------------------------------------","[doctor] donna torres , date of birth , 08/01/1980 .
[doctor] hi donna ! how are you ?
[patient] i'm good . how about you ?
[doctor] i'm doing well , thank you . and so , i saw that dr. brown put you on buspar . have you been on that before ?
[patient] no , that's new .
[doctor] okay . how is it working for you ?
[patient] my anxiety is going good now , thankfully . i'm serious , it was brutal in november and december . finally , i was like , "" i can not do this . "" i have no idea why it happened . dr. ward did put me on singulair , and she did say we need to be careful because singulair can cause anxiety . so i'm not sure if that was the issue or what .
[doctor] mm . okay .
[patient] and it would , um , start usually during the day , at work .
[doctor] i see .
[patient] i mean , i'm fine now .
[doctor] well , that's good , that things have settled . i do wonder if some of what you are dealing with is hormonal , and that's why i was asking . 'cause you were on the progesterone , and i feel like you were having some irritability back then too .
[patient] i did .
[doctor] and that was before we started the progesterone .
[patient] yes .
[doctor] so i know we started it for regulating your periods , but perhaps it helped with this also .
[patient] yeah . and before , in november and december , i noticed that the week before my period , my anxiety would go through the roof . which then , i knew my period was coming . then it turned into my anxiety spiking just at random times .
[doctor] hmm , okay .
[patient] and it seemed like it was for no reason .
[doctor] but november and december you were on the progesterone at that time .
[patient] yes .
[doctor] all right . so not really a link there , all right .
[patient] yeah , i do n't know .
[doctor] yeah , i do n't know either . um , sometimes with the aging process , that can happen too .
[patient] i figured maybe that's what it was .
[doctor] and we did go through the golive in november and december , so that can be pretty stressful also .
[patient] yeah , and at work , that's when i first started to lead the process of delivering the results to patients with covid . in the beginning of the whole pandemic , patients would have to wait nine days before they'd get their results . and then we opened the evaluation centers and the covid clinic . so i think it just took a toll on me .
[doctor] yeah , i can absolutely see that .
[patient] yeah , and then i was feeling selfish because i was n't even on the front lines . i mean , i was supporting people , sure , but i was n't in the icu . so i felt selfish and guilty . i mean , hands down , the physicians and nurses were in the thick of it and there i was , having anxiety . and it felt ridiculous .
[doctor] well , honestly , you feel how you feel and what you were doing was n't easy as well , so ... but let's see . i need to just put this dax back to work . all right , so no other issues whatsoever ?
[patient] no .
[doctor] have you lost weight ?
[patient] no , but i stopped taking the camila birth control . my hunger level was at a new high . i mean , i was eating constantly . i felt like , "" what is going on ? ""
[doctor] all right .
[patient] and now i am feeling better .
[doctor] okay , that's good . and your masked face , though , it does look thinner .
[patient] well , the past six months i have lost some weight .
[doctor] okay , good . um , anything else going on ?
[patient] no .
[doctor] all right . so your pap was in 2019 . i do n't think that we need to repeat that because it was negative/negative . um , have you ever had an abnormal pap ?
[patient] not with you , but i did around 2009 , and then i had to be seen every six months for a while . and then i had a normal pap .
[doctor] all right , well , let's just repeat it then .
[patient] yeah , that's fine with me , to be safe .
[doctor] okay . i know it sounds superstitious , but i feel like with all the immunocompromising , the pressure , the stress that people's bodies have been under , and the potential for getting covid or the vaccine ... i have actually seen some , um , an increase in abnormal paps in people who have been fine for a while . so that's why i figure let's just check .
[patient] okay . i fight the vaccine fight every day at home because my husband is n't ready to get it . same with my daughter . she shares the same worries as her dad in how it'll impact her when she gets older .
[doctor] have you had the vaccine ?
[patient] yes , i have . and so has my son . he , um , has had his first already .
[doctor] okay . well , you know , you can only do what you can do .
[patient] yeah , i agree .
[doctor] all right . well , let's complete your exam .
[patient] all right .
[doctor] so let's take a deep breath . and again . all right , you can breathe normally . all right , and take one more deep breath . okay , now i'm gon na touch your neck . go ahead and swallow . perfect . and just place your hand above your head . okay , i do feel some little bumps .
[patient] yeah , but they're not as big as they were .
[doctor] mm-hmm . okay , in this breast it does feel a little bit denser . does it hurt at all ?
[patient] it does , where your left hand just was .
[doctor] okay , right here ?
[patient] yeah , down here . but whenever i breastfed , it was always sore there too . i had a clog and something else . the lumps do feel smaller , but they are still there , unfortunately .
[doctor] yeah , they are . uh , well now i do n't know , because if it was the progesterone , they would've gone away .
[patient] yeah .
[doctor] all right , well just let your knees just op- relax and open . how's the itching or discomfort ? are you still using the cream ?
[patient] yes , and i actually need to get that refilled for the first time ever .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] uh , but yeah , i use it once a week and it does help .
[doctor] okay , great . all right , looks good .
[patient] good .
[doctor] you can go ahead and sit up .
[patient] thank you .
[doctor] all right , so typically the lumps would often just shrink up pretty quickly after you've had one or two cycles , and you've had two cycles so far . so i think let's just keep monitoring them for now .
[patient] okay . and what could that mean ?
[doctor] well , so just like people have an increased risk of breast cancer , there's also an increased risk for breast issues . you know what i mean ? so for example , cysts and lumps and fibroadenomas , those are all benign things . they're annoying and require some workup , but they're all benign .
[patient] and i'm- i'm just worried because i'm almost 40 and my mom was almost 45 when she was diagnosed with breast cancer . so i mean , i know there's nothing i can do about it , but it's just i feel like , uh , we had it under control and now it is n't .
[doctor] well , i would n't say that . i mean , i feel like we're at a point where we have a good cadence for you having surveillance on things , and i think you are more aware of your breasts than ever before , and things actually have n't changed .
[patient] yeah .
[doctor] so those are all good things .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] because , um , if it was cancer , we'd actually , we would see some change .
[patient] we would ? okay , thank you for explaining that .
[doctor] yeah . so i know it's annoying and distressing , but i think that's where we're at . it's annoying that you have the breast issue , and it's annoying that we have to follow them .
[patient] yeah , i agree there .
[doctor] um , but the only extra that i could po- , uh , potentially do , is we could get a breast specialist on the team and have you start to follow with them . and one of the advantages there is that they sometimes will do an ultrasound as an extension of their physical exam , in the office , to check out it- check it out on their own . uh , they also have a lot more experience and more willingness to sometimes perform procedures earlier , if they think it needs , um , if they think it needs to be done . and i think they tend to be much quicker than , you know , like radiology as to biopsy it .
[patient] okay . i'll do whatever you think i should .
[doctor] all right . well , i think since you're feeling worried , let's go ahead and we can get them on board . i'll send out a referral and they will call you within the next couple of business days to schedule .
[patient] okay , i think that sounds great .
[doctor] all right . i do too . all right , well any questions or anything else we can discuss today ?
[patient] no , i think i'm all set .
[doctor] all right , good . all right , well have a good rest of your day and just give us a call if you need anything else .
[patient] all right , thank you . you have a good day too .

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

1. Asthma.
- Medical Reasoning: The patient has experienced an increased need to use her albuterol inhaler. She is not currently utilizing a daily medication. At this time, we will try a daily medication since it looks like she might be having some allergies.
- Patient Education and Counseling: I explained the side effects of albuterol to the patient. We also discussed Singulair and that she should start to see a difference in her breathing within approximately 1 month.
- Medical Treatment: We will start her on a daily asthma medication. She can continue to use the albuterol inhaler. We will start her on Singulair in about a month.

2. Mood.
- Medical Reasoning: The patient reports being under a lot of stress with school. I believe this may be attributing to her mood.
- Medical Treatment: I would like for the patient to be seen by a therapist. She will also complete our screening questionnaire.

Patient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.

INSTRUCTIONS

The patient will follow up in 6 weeks for recheck.

---------------------------------------------","[doctor] okay
[patient] good morning
[doctor] good morning thanks doctor doctor cooper i'm i'm you know i'm a little i'm sad to be in here but you know thanks for taking me in i appreciate it
[patient] sure absolutely what can i help you with today
[doctor] so you know i've been dealing with my asthma and like i tried to join sports but it's really kind of it's getting hard you know and i i i just wonder if there's something that can be done because i really do like playing water polo
[patient] but i'm having difficulty breathing sometimes i've had to like you know stop matches and sit on the side just to kind of like catch my breath and use my inhaler so i was wondering if there was something we could do about it
[doctor] and then like i'm kind of a little bit worried i think my mood is getting a little a little worrisome and i i wanted to explore like what my options were
[patient] okay let's talk about the asthma first so what inhaler are you using now
[doctor] i have an albuterol inhaler
[patient] okay and when when you're having trouble it's usually just around sports that is it keeping you up at night
[doctor] so i do n't really like wake up at night a lot typically like it's sports like you know if i'm doing anything like crazy aerobic or like running or anything i do notice that if any if i'm around smoke i do start coughing a little bit but most of the time it's sports
[patient] okay and can you describe a little bit for me what happens
[doctor] i start to yeah no so i start to feel like there is like some phlegm building up in my in my throat and i start coughing like my chest gets tight i start wheezing and i just have to sit down or else i'm gon na get like lightheaded too
[patient] okay and then when you use your inhaler
[doctor] mm-hmm
[patient] does it does it alleviate the problem
[doctor] so yeah it helps with that like phlegm feeling you know but i still i still have to sit down you know and like breathe and then the thing that i hate about that inhaler is i start getting like shaky is that supposed to be happening
[patient] yes that is unfortunately normal and a side effect with the inhaler
[doctor] okay
[patient] so you use you're using two puffs of the inhaler
[doctor] mm-hmm
[patient] for the symptoms
[doctor] yes
[patient] and then you sit down and does it does it get better within about fifteen minutes or so
[doctor] yeah yeah it does but you know i had to like step out of the the pool to make that happen i'm hoping that there is something else we can do okay have you ever taken any daily medications for your asthma an inhaler or singulair or anything like that no i i just use my inhaler whenever i have an attack
[patient] okay so that's something we might wan na consider but how often is it happening
[doctor] pretty much every time i do any kind of aerobic workout
[patient] okay and outside of physical activity you're not having any problems
[doctor] yeah there's that part where like if i'm around somebody who has been smoking a lot or is currently smoking but i usually just step away i do n't even like to be around them you know that makes sense
[patient] alright well we will look at that tell me about the mood issues you are having
[doctor] yeah so one of the reasons i got into like trying to get into sports is like i feel like you know you you feel a lot more energized and a lot you know happier but like lately i've just been kinda stressed out you know like i have i have like sats that i need to study for i've got like all these ap classes you know there's just it i feel like there's a lot of pressure and you know like i get it but there are times where i'm just like really down and i i do n't really know what else i can do
[patient] okay that makes sense any any difficulty with focusing or you're having difficulty retaining information or is it more feeling sad not having motivation
[doctor] so i think it's like a lot of sadness a lot of like you know i do n't really i kinda feel like you know i do n't really like want to do anything you know my friends will go out and i'll just be like i'd rather be at home i am really tired a lot too
[patient] okay alright well let me let me go ahead and check you out
[doctor] mm-hmm
[patient] and then we can talk a little bit more
[doctor] okay
[patient] i'm gon na take a listen to your heart and lungs
[doctor] mm-hmm
[patient] and everything sounds good
[doctor] let me take a look at your eyes
[patient] mm-hmm and in your ears everything looks okay have you had any problems with allergies you have seasonal allergies or anything like that
[doctor] yeah i think so yeah
[patient] i do see just a little bit of fluid in the ears
[doctor] mm-hmm
[patient] and i'm gon na look in your mouth too
[doctor] okay
[patient] and throat looks fine no tonsils
[doctor] mm-hmm
[patient] lem me go ahead and have you lay back on the table and i'll take a listen to your stomach
[doctor] okay
[patient] everything sounds okay i'm gon na feel around just to make sure everything feels normal
[doctor] mm-hmm
[patient] everything feels fine and i'm gon na check reflexes and they're all normal
[doctor] awesome
[patient] it's really hard to do with actual patient so in terms of the asthma i think we could try a daily medication since it looks like you might be having a little bit of allergies maybe we can try some singulair
[doctor] mm-hmm
[patient] and start with that once you are on that daily and you can continue to use the albuterol inhaler those side effects unfortunately you're right it's it's just one of the expected side effects with an albuterol inhaler i would recommend just what you're doing just sit down for a little bit after you take it
[doctor] and we will get you started on the singulair probably within about a month you should see a difference so i will have you come back in about six weeks and follow up and see how you're doing with that
[patient] in terms of the mood is this new for you
[doctor] yeah i think so like when i started this year
[patient] and it sounds like related to school expectations and the stress with saps and all of that
[doctor] yeah
[patient] okay let's consider having you start seeing a therapist i think that would be a good place to start
[doctor] mm-hmm
[patient] and we will do some screening questionnaires and and then follow up in a couple weeks on that too
[doctor] okay alright sounds like a plan okay

[doctor] hmmm okay understood alright well listen let's go ahead and examine you okay so so on your physical exam your physical exam is pretty normal unremarkable for the most part and you know few things a few exceptions so first of all on your heent exam your eye exam your extraocular motions are intact without pain you have a funduscopic exam that shows no papilledema that's good that just means there's no swelling in the back of your eye and on your neck exam you do have some posterior mild posterior paraspinal muscular tenderness in the cervical spine and in bilateral trapezius musculature as well and some tightness in those muscles as well and otherwise on your exam let's see your heart exam on your heart exam you have that grade three out of six systolic ejection murmur that's unchanged from your prior exam so it just means i hear some sounds in your heart as it's beating and i'm not too worried about that we'll watch that and otherwise normal heart exam and and your physical examination otherwise is normal and unremarkable and so now let's talk about my assessment and your plan so carolyn for your first problem of the headache i do think that you have a tension type headache and i think this because you've got some tension and tightness in your paraspinal muscles meaning the muscles around your neck and your shoulders and you know working at the computer i think is contributing to this and also probably the stress so you can continue to take that tylenol for the pain i'm also gon na give you a mild muscle relaxant i'll write you for flexeril five milligrams three times a day and you can take that that will help relax those muscles in your neck and that should help with the symptoms i want you to come back or give us a call if the headaches become more severe or suddenly worsen or you develop a fever but i do n't think that this is a a sign of a stroke or any bleeding in your brain or anything like that i think it's more related to tightness in your muscles in your neck now for your second problem of your diabetes mellitus let's continue you on the metformin five hundred milligrams i am going to order a hemoglobin a1c and also a cbc and a chem-12 to check some of your blood tests blood chemistries and so forth and we will continue you on the metformin i do want you to check your blood sugars daily and that will be very helpful so when you come back in a month i want you to bring those numbers with you we can talk about it again and please do try to get back into your exercise routine that's really gon na help you keep those blood sugars under control as well okay so how does that sound for a plan any other questions for me
[patient] well would it so only call if if it gets worse or not any better
[doctor] yeah that that just right but also let's set up an appointment in four weeks and i wan na see you back in four weeks if it's not if the headache is not better within the next few days with this flexeril then you can give us a call and and get back in later this week or early next but definitely if things get worse give us a call sooner and you know i meant to ask you on i wanted to ask if you had a history of any any trauma meaning have you hit your head or you have n't fallen hit your head or anything like that have you
[patient] no no i think it's just stress
[doctor] okay alright understood okay great well then i'll see you back in a month if not before okay you take care of yourself nice seeing you

[doctor] okay got it alright well i'll i'll examine you in a second but before we do that let's talk about some of the other conditions that we're kinda following you for i'm looking at your problem list now and you've got a history of diabetes and you're on metformin five hundred milligram twice a day and your how are you doing with your blood sugars and your and your diet and exercise
[patient] yeah i i check my sugar two or three times a week most of the time it's in that one twenty to one forty range
[doctor] okay
[patient] yeah i take my medicine okay my diet is alright you know i could be fifteen pounds lighter that would be alright but
[doctor] sure
[patient] i i i think the sugar has been okay
[doctor] okay we checked your hemoglobin a1c last time i'm looking at your records in epic and it showed that it was you know seven . one so it's it's it's good but it could be better any you know we talked about it controlling your diet or improving your diet and trying to have a balanced meal and not eating some of these sweets and high sugar items how is that going i know you had talked about your wife being a great cook and making cookies and that's hard to stay away from obviously how are things going with that
[patient] yeah she still makes cookies and i still eat them but you know we are trying to trying to do better trying to stay away from more of those carbs and focus on you know less carby less sweet stuff
[doctor] okay alright yeah that's always a struggle i certainly understand but you know really important with your diabetes just to prevent some of the complications like kidney failure and eye problems and just keep your sugar under balance so i'll order another hemoglobin a1c today we'll check that again today and and you know just reemphasizing the controlling your diet and exercise is super important and then we'll have those results back we'll we'll see if we need to make any modifications okay
[patient] okay
[doctor] for your high blood pressure your blood pressure in the clinic looks pretty good it's about one twenty over seventy right now we have you on norvasc five milligrams once a day how are things going with that are you are you checking that periodically or any issues with that at all
[patient] yeah i guess i check it maybe once a week or two or three times a month and it it the vast majority of the time when i check it it's good usually either that one twenty to one thirty over seventy to eighty range i i think the blood pressure's okay
[doctor] okay
[patient] i have n't had any real problems there i i have had some some swelling in my ankles though
[doctor] okay is that new or is that been going on for a while
[patient] well it it started maybe i do n't know a month or two after i started the norvasc
[doctor] okay
[patient] and i was just wondering if the two might be related
[doctor] yeah i mean certainly it could be it is you know sometimes that medication can cause that so i'll i'll examine you in a second and see if we need to make any modifications okay
[patient] okay
[doctor] alright so and your anything else bothering you today
[patient] no i'm we're doing okay i think
[doctor] so let me examine you for a second i'm gon na go ahead and gabriel i'm gon na do my magic exam now let's pretend i i'm just gon na verbalize some of my findings as i do my exam and so
[patient] these are like my video visit exams
[doctor] exactly so your neck exam has no jvd there is no bruits that i can hear your lung exam no rales no wheezing on your heart exam you do have a two over six systolic ejection murmur you had that in the past so i'm not too worried about that otherwise regular rate and rhythm on your heart exam on your on your on your belly exam is nice and soft on your back exam you do have some tenderness on the left paraspinal area right where i'm pressing right there your straight leg raise test is negative your reflexes are normal you have some just some tenderness in the lower back in the paraspinal area of your back when i palpate there otherwise your neurological exam is normal on your extremity exam you do have this one plus nonpitting edema of your lower extremities which is a little bit of swelling in your ankles no calf tenderness negative homans sign no signs of blood clot that's what that means so let me just review what you know explain what all this means so the back pain the first problem that you're here today for i think this is more of a muscular sprain i'm gon na recommend we start you on some anti-inflammatory naprosyn five hundred five hundred milligrams twice a day and flexeril ten milligrams twice a day as well i'm gon na refer you to for for physical therapy to help strengthen some of the muscles in your lower back i do n't think you need an x-ray at this stage why do n't we start with physical therapy and the muscle relaxers and the pain medicines if it does n't get better then we can get an x-ray but right now i would start with that if that's okay with you any questions about that
[patient] no
[doctor] okay for the diabetes the the second problem that we talked about today i'm gon na order another hemoglobin a1c continue the metformin five hundred milligrams twice a day why do n't we have you come back in about two weeks and we should have some of the results back and we can discuss if we need to make any modifications for that but right now we will continue the course and we will go from there okay for the high blood pressure you do have this one plus edema in your legs i'm gon na go ahead and order some blood work today i'm gon na go ahead and stop the norvasc and we'll put you on some hydrochlorothiazide ten milligrams once a day and if that does n't get if the swelling does n't go away i'm gon na do some more testing for right now let's get some sort off with some cbc and a bmp i'm gon na check your kidney function i'm gon na get another ekg and also i'm gon na get a chest x-ray and we'll go from there but hopefully this will go away once we stop this medication since it started around that time okay okay and i think that's it anything else we forgot about do you need refills for anything

Patient Name: christine hernandez
Age: 39.0
Gender: female 
Chief Complaint: hypothyroidism 
Secondary Complaints: weight loss; acne

---------------------------------------------
MEDICAL NOTE:

CHIEF COMPLAINT

Hypothyroidism.
Abnormal liver enzymes.
Abnormal weight gain.
Acne vulgaris.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Christine Hernandez is a 39-year-old female who presents today for evaluation and management of abnormal liver enzymes and hypothyroidism.

When the patient was last seen, her thyroid medicine was changed to Unithroid, but due to the cost of $75, she has not yet started the new medicine and continues taking her previous thyroid medicine. She denies utilizing the coupon that was previously recommended for the Unithroid. Similarly, the patient was prescribed Epiduo for her acne vulgaris, which she did not fill due to the cost of $100. She tried filling both prescriptions at Walmart.

Mrs. Hernandez still presents with abnormal weight gain. She questioned if her oral contraceptive Microgestin, which was discontinued, could have been the cause. Additional symptoms included acne, hirsutism. She is attempting to modify her intake and plans to resume her gym membership in July as she will be on vacation. She inquired about the impact on weight loss of chromium, CLA, and amino acids.

The patient confirmed that she is taking her high dose Vitamin D as prescribed. She does suffer from constipation and she treats with MiraLAX.

She denies previous treatment for her acne vulgaris. She denies ever using clindamycin topical antibiotic. She reports having sensitive skin, developing rashes with various skin products.

PAST HISTORY

Medical
Hypothyroidism.
Acne Vulgaris.
Vitamin D deficiency.
Abnormal weight gain.
Hirsutism.
Constipation.

CURRENT MEDICATIONS

Benzoyl Peroxide.
Clindamycin Gel applied topically.
Vitamin D 2000 IU daily.
Unithroid.
MiraLAX.

ALLERGIES

No known allergies.

RESULTS

Dexamethasone Suppression Test: Normal.

Salivary Cortisol Tests: 2 out of 3 were normal. Not consistent with Cushing’s Syndrome.

Hepatic Function Panel: ALT 128.
Lipid Panel: Total cholesterol 222 mg/dL, HDL 44 mg/dL, LDL 153 mg/dL, non-HDL 178 mg/dL.

FAI: Normal.

ASSESSMENT

• Hypothyroidism.
• Abnormal liver enzymes.
• Abnormal weight gain.
• Acne vulgaris
• Vitamin D deficiency.
• Hirsutism

PLAN

Hypothyroidism
The patient will again attempt to initiate Unithroid. I have printed out the prescription and a discount card, which should result in a reduced price. She will contact my office if she encounters additional issues.

Abnormal liver enzymes
We have seen improvement since the discontinuation of Microgestin. I recommended the spermicide Phexxi for alternative birth control. The patient will also continue working on weight loss, which should additionally improve her liver enzymes.

Abnormal weight gain
Cushing’s Syndrome has been ruled out. I reviewed the weight loss study with the patient, she will call within a month if she is interested in participating. I advised her to follow a low carbohydrate, low cholesterol, abstain from alcohol, and reduce fatty foods diet.

Acne vulgaris
Epiduo was not covered and too expensive. The patient will try benzoyl peroxide and Clindamycin separately to see if the price improves.

Vitamin D deficiency
The patient will complete the high dose vitamin D and then should start vitamin D 2000 IU per day to maintain her levels.

Hirsutism
Her androgen levels were normal.

INSTRUCTIONS

She will repeat all labs prior to her next visit.","[doctor] next patient is christine hernandez , uh , date of birth is january 13th , 1982 .
[doctor] hey , miss christine , how are you doing today ?
[patient] i'm good , thanks . how are you ?
[doctor] i'm pretty good . so it looks like you've completed the covid vaccine , that's great .
[patient] yes , i did .
[doctor] anything new since your last visit ?
[patient] no , i did all the tests that you had recommended me to take . i have n't been able to take the thyroid medicine , the one that you prescribed , as i'm still taking my old one . um , the price was a little high on the new one .
[doctor] okay , so did ... did you try the coupon that i gave you ?
[patient] i did not try the coupon , uh , there was a charge of $ 75 .
[doctor] okay , well , next time that ... that coupon should help , and it should only be about $ 3 .
[patient] okay , um ... i do n't have it , do you happen to have another one you can give me ?
[doctor] yep , right here .
[patient] wonderful , thank you so much , and ... and then the gel , they are charging me $ 100 for it . so , i do n't know if this is because it's a ... it's wal-mart , or if i should try somewhere else , or ... maybe you know how or where i can get it cheaper .
[doctor] yeah , let's try something else , um ... sometimes it can be cheaper if we just prescribe you the individual ingredients of a medication , rather than the , the combined medication itself .
[patient] that would be great .
[doctor] so , that's clindamycin gel and benzoyl peroxide , uh , maybe by doing them separately , they could be a lot cheaper . so , that we can do . the unithroid , with the discount code , should only be about $ 9 for 90 days .
[patient] okay , that would be great . yeah , they were charging me $ 75 , and i just could n't pay that .
[doctor] maybe we'll try different pharmacy , as well .
[patient] okay . so , do you think that my weight gain could have been the birth control that i was taking before that caused it ?
[doctor] maybe . i do n't really see an endocrine cause for it , at least , so i would need to see the , the hyperandrogynism or high testosterone . or , a high dhea , to cause acne , or hair growth , or any of that stuff . but , the numbers are n't showing up out of range .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] i really do n't see any endocrine cause for it , like i said . your growth hormone was fine , but we definitely want to and need to treat it . um , i do n't know if we talked about maybe a little weight loss study .
[patient] you mentioned the weight loss study , and you mentioned that i have some meal plans , um , that you had given me . i still have those , too .
[doctor] have you tried to make any changes in the diet since the last time we spoke ?
[patient] i've been trying to get better . i will start back at the gym in july , because of my contract , i had to put a hold on it until then .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] so , i do want to start doing that . i will be a little freer since , um , i'll be on vacation after july 8th .
[doctor] okay , good .
[patient] and then my cousin was telling me to ask you about cla , because it's supposed to help your metabolism . is that okay to take ?
[doctor] um , i'm not sure . what is c , cla ?
[patient] i'm not sure what it is , either .
[doctor] okay , well , i'm unfamiliar with it , so ...
[patient] okay . i also have a coworker who has a thyroid issue too , and she suggested to try chromium for weight loss .
[doctor] so , that likely will not help too much . you can try either , if you really want to , but then ... it will not accept you into the weight loss study if you try those two .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] chromium is just a supplement and it wo n't help that much .
[patient] it wo n't , okay , thank you .
[doctor] it wo n't hurt ... okay , i should n't say that it wo n't hurt , but , it also wo n't help that much . so , it's up to you .
[patient] okay . and so , my cousin also suggested amino acids , and that i might find them in certain foods , i guess , for my workout .
[doctor] yeah . amino acids are fine , they wo n't , wo n't really help with weight loss either , but it might help , uh , you replenish , and just kind of , feel hydrated .
[patient] okay . are they proteins ? um , my cousin said she had lost some weight , and has been working out every day , but she does n't work , so ... i do n't know .
[doctor] yes , amino acids are what make up the protein , which is in any food you eat , with any protein . so , meats , dairy , nuts , any of that sort of thing .
[patient] okay , thank you . got it .
[doctor] all right . um , are you allergic to any medications ?
[patient] no , not that i know of .
[doctor] okay . is your s- skin pretty sensitive ?
[patient] yes .
[doctor] all right .
[patient] um , yeah , my size , i will start getting rashes , with different products .
[doctor] and have you ever tried clindamycin topical , as an antibiotic for your acne ?
[patient] no , i've never tried anything for it .
[doctor] okay . we might give you some of that .
[patient] okay . and i also want to mention that my feet do swell up a lot .
[doctor] okay . i'm ... let me take a look at that for just a moment . um , any constipation ?
[patient] yes , i also do have that problem .
[doctor] all right . mira- miralax will definitely help with that .
[patient] okay , yes , my doctor did also recommend that .
[doctor] great . all right , let's do an exam real quick . please have a seat on this table and i'll listen to your lungs and heart .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] all right , deep breath . all right , again .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] all right , sounds good .
[patient] great .
[doctor] let me take a look at your feet and ankles .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] all right , they look okay right now , certainly let your doctor know about this if it gets any worse or reoccurs .
[patient] okay , i will do that .
[doctor] now , let's go over your lab work . so , when you took that pill , the dexamethasone test , you passed , which means you do n't have cushing's syndrome . on that test , at least . the salivary cortisol , though , unless you did one wrong ... two of them were completely normal and one was abnormal , so , we might need to repeat that in the future .
[patient] okay , that's okay .
[doctor] all right , so , your cholesterol was quite high . the total cholesterol was 222 . the good cholesterol was about 44 . the bad was 153 , and it should be less than 100 . the non-hdl was about 178 , and it should be less than 130 . the good cholesterol should be over 50 , and it was 44 . so , your screen for diabetes is ... was fine . you do have a vitamin d deficiency , and , i do n't know if we started the vitamin d yet , or not .
[patient] yes , we did . i- i do need to take one today , though .
[doctor] okay . so , i also checked a lot of other pituitary hormones , iron levels ... everything else seemed to be pretty good , and in decent range .
[patient] okay , that sounds great . so , i wanted to also show you my liver enzymes , um , because i have n't come back since then ... but i was also happy , because one of them was back to normal .
[doctor] okay , great . let's see them .
[patient] okay . so , the one that's 30 , that was almost 200 not so long ago .
[doctor] yeah , your alt was about 128 .
[patient] okay , and , and back in october was 254 .
[doctor] yeah , this is much better .
[patient] okay , great . and then it dropped in january , and then it dropped a little more in march , since i stopped taking the medicine in december .
[doctor] okay , that's good . so ... i'm proud of you with the course of your labs , so before i forget , i'm going to , uh , just put your labs into the computer today , and i wo n't be checking your vitamin d level for some time .
[patient] okay . so , with the thyroid , and the low vitamin d , does that always happen together ?
[doctor] um , i do have a lot of people that have thyroid , thyroid issues and they have vitamin d deficiency .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] this is what i'm , um , i'm going to do . i'm going to put , print out your prescriptions , so you can shop around at the pharmacies and see if you can find better prices .
[patient] okay , that way i can go ask them and try cvs .
[doctor] yeah , that sounds like a plan .
[patient] okay , good . so , the weight loss study that you mentioned , when does that start ? or , how does that work ?
[doctor] so , we are about to start , as we just got approval last week , and we are just waiting on our paperwork so we can get started .
[patient] okay , and what's involved with that ?
[doctor] so , it'll involve you receiving a medication which has been used for diabetes treatment , and it works mostly in the gut on satiety , or satiety hormones . um , the most common side effects are going to be nausea , vomiting , diarrhea and constipation . they are s- uh , six arms , to the study . one is a placebo , the other ones are a , various as ... various dosages of the medication , excuse me . um , you would receive an injection once a week . also , keep in mind that most of the weight loss medications are not covered by insurance .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] so , it's a way of getting them , but , the odds of getting one of the arms with the medication that are in your favor , right , might be only one out of five of our hundred patients that we have on the list for the study that will receive the placebo .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] does that make sense ?
[patient] yes , it does .
[doctor] so , we do expect pretty big weight loss , because of what we learn in diabetes study . so , it's a year long , uh , process , and it's an injection once a week . you come in weekly for the first four , five weeks , i believe . and then , after that , it's once a month . you do get a stipend for partici- for participating in the study , and parking is validated , and whatever else that you need for the study .
[patient] okay , do you know how much the stipend is ?
[doctor] um , i will have to double check for you , and , you do n't have to be my patient , you just have to meet the criteria . so the criteria is a bmi greater than 30 , if you do n't have any other medical condition . or , a bmi greater than 27 , if you do have another medical condition , like your cholesterol . um , a bmi greater than 27 would quali- uh , qualify you .
[patient] i have a friend who might be interested , and she does have diabetes .
[doctor] if she has d- diabetes , then she wo n't qualify .
[patient] okay , you ca n't if you ... if you have diabetes , got it .
[doctor] correct . yeah , the only thing that , um , they can not have , really , is diabetes . so , either a psychiatric disease , or schizophrenia , bipolar , things like that .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] but , if they have hypertension , high cholesterol , things like that ... they can definitely sign up .
[patient] and they can , okay . thank you for explaining that .
[doctor] of course . so , do you want me to try to get you into that study ? or , would you just like to try , me to prescribe something ? it's kind of up to you .
[patient] i think i'll just wait for a little bit now .
[doctor] all right , sounds good . i'll give you the information for the research , it's just in my office . um , it is a different phone number , though . so then , if you're interested , just call us within a month , because i do n't know how long , uh , the , the wait will be .
[patient] okay , will do .
[doctor] perfect . so , let me go grab your discount card for the unithroid . um , when you go in to activate it , the instructions are on this card , and then you use your insurance ... then , show them this , and ask how much it'll cost . if it's too expensive , just let me know .
[patient] i will . thank you so much for your help on that .
[doctor] you're welcome . then , what i did is , i gave you a topical antibiotic , plus i gave you the benzoyl peroxide . so , the peroxide may bleach your sheets , but , you want to make sure to take it and apply it at night , so you do n't have a reaction from the sun during the day .
[patient] okay , i can do that .
[doctor] but , you do also want to make sure that you do n't mess up your sheets .
[patient] okay , sounds good .
[doctor] um , so , that's that . and then , let's see how you do on the other medications . i think this will , this will get better . in the meantime , a low-carb diet , avoid alcohol and fatty foods , and low chole- cholesterol foods .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] and again , once you finish your dose of vitamin d , for the vitamin d deficiency , you're gon na start with the 2000iu daily , so that you're able to maintain those levels . sound good ?
[patient] yes , that sounds great .
[doctor] i really think your liver enzymes are going to get better once you lose the weight , though .
[patient] okay , that would be great .
[doctor] since we stopped your birth control , we can try once called phexxi , which is kind of like a spermicide , basically .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] and you just apply it before intercourse .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] if you need some , uh , just let me know .
[patient] okay , i will . i'll let you know .
[doctor] okay , perfect . so , stay put for me now . i'm going to go see if they have discount samples , and bring you that prescription . and then , i'm going to order the labs for next time .
[patient] okay , great , thank you so much .
[doctor] you're welcome .
[doctor] so , under the plan , under abnormal liver enzymes , they have improved since discontinuation of her birth control . under abnormal weight gain , her dexamethasone suppression test was normal . two out of three salivary cortisol tests were normal , not consistent with cushing's , and therefore we're ruling out cushing's . under her hirsutism , her androgen levels were normal . for the acne vulgaris , the epiduo was not covered , so we'll try benzoyl peroxide with clindamycin , and remove the previous information . on the hyperthyroidism , we'll print out her prescriptions . unithroid should be better priced with the discount card , and we'll repeat levels of everything before next visit . thanks .",3536.217391304348,"Benzoyl Peroxide.

MEDICAL NOTE:

CHIEF COMPLAINT

Hypogonadism.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Mr. Paul Edwards is a 59-year-old male, an established patient, who presents to the clinic today for hypogonadism. He was last seen on 11/24/2020. The patient’s history includes positive for HIV, and today he is concerned with gynecomastia.

The patient is doing well, overall, and feels the testosterone is helping. He reports weight stability, feels lively, good, more vigorous, and he is sleeping well. He also thinks the testosterone is having a positive effect on his blood work. He endorses that his triglycerides have always been elevated and adds that they were as high as 265 mg/dL. The patient presented a copy of his bloodwork, showing a significant decrease in his cholesterol after 5 months. Mr. Edwards questioned if the changes in his blood work were due to the testosterone. He also noted that his red blood cell count has not increased. The patient inquired about possible benefits of Indole-3-carbinol, which is a broccoli extract for estrogen control.

Currently, the patient is dosing 140 ng/dL of testosterone per week and inquired if his dose could be increased to 175 ng/dL. He recalled that he had recently injected testosterone before his last testosterone blood work was performed; last testosterone levels were greater than 1500 ng/dL. The patient confirms continued daily use of Finasteride and Cialis, prescribed by me, and stated he needs a refill for both.

Mr. Edwards mentioned he is taking correct steps to get his life ""together."" He also uses a med calendar to help with medication compliance.

PAST HISTORY

Medical
HIV

SOCIAL HISTORY

Utilizes med calendar to support medication compliance.
Actively trying to get his life together.

CURRENT MEDICATIONS

Cialis 5 mg tablet by mouth on days he exercises, 2.5 mg tablet by mouth on days without exercise.
Finasteride 5 mg half tablet daily.
Testosterone cypionate 140 mg.

RESULTS

PSA 0.6 ng/mL.
Triglycerides 145 mg/dL.
Total testosterone 1500 ng/dL, 11/24/2021.

ASSESSMENT

• Hypogonadism.

PLAN

I recommend maintaining current management. The patient’s last testosterone levels were greater than 1500 ng/dL, although this level was likely related to his recent injection. He requested an increase to his testosterone cypionate from 140 mg to 175 mg, which I denied due to his already high testosterone levels. I counseled the patient on the risks associated with high testosterone levels and Indole-3-carbinol and it’s lacking evidence to support his estrogen levels. The last time his estradiol levels were checked, they were normal; recommend annual screening.

I provided paper prescription refills for Cialis and Finasteride.","[doctor] next patient is paul edwards , date of birth is january 15th 1962 . so he's a 59 year old hiv positive gentleman here for hypogonadism . patient was last seen on november 24th 2020 . his notable things are number one , he is on 1 milliliter every 10 days , uh , his levels were less than 300 to begin with . he's on finasteride currently . he also takes cialis daily so he takes all his pills just from me . um , patient's other area of concern is gynecomastia which is ... which we will discuss with him today . his last psa was 0.66 and his last testosterone was greater than 1,500 .
[doctor] hey , how are you today ?
[patient] all right , how have you been ?
[doctor] i'm good .
[patient] good , good .
[doctor] have you lost some weight or are you at least putting on some muscle ? you look trim .
[patient] no , i think i'm pretty much the same as i've always been .
[doctor] really ? okay , maybe it's just your black shirt . makes you look thin .
[patient] yeah , i guess that's it .
[doctor] so health wise , how is everything going ?
[patient] good , the testosterone's going well .
[doctor] that's great .
[patient] uh , it helped me out . i feel good , more vigorous , sleeping well and i think it's having some positive effects . not so much physically because like i said i've- i've been this way my whole life , but i'm seeing some good improvements in my bloodwork .
[doctor] okay , well that's good .
[patient] so the finasteride i'm only taking half a pill , it's the 5 milligram one .
[doctor] yeah , i remember you telling me that .
[patient] and cialis , on the days i work out i take 5 milligrams otherwise i take two and a half milligram pills , but , uh , i have been out of it .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] but overall i'm doing well , i'm actually taking the correct steps to get my life together .
[doctor] good . it's always great to hear . well let's take a look . uhm , i'm gon na listen to your heart and lungs .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] please use my general exam template , all right . just take a few breaths .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] in and out .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] all right , everything sounds good , no concerns there .
[patient] great . so i wanted to show you something .
[doctor] sure .
[patient] look at this .
[doctor] okay , this is your cholesterol ?
[patient] yeah , my cholesterol and triglycerides . uh , i used to have high triglycerides , you see they were 265 milligrams per deciliter , and i took my first dose of the testosterone on the 28th .
[doctor] right .
[patient] now 5 months later look at my numbers .
[doctor] wow , that's remarkable .
[patient] is it the test ? it's the only change .
[doctor] i do n't know , i have n't honestly seen many guys over the years that have cholesterol problems and this . i mean there's a big correlation between diabetic control and testosterone replacement , meaning those who get good levels of their test see their diabetic control improve .
[patient] yeah .
[doctor] but i have n't seen a lot of data on the impact on cholesterol . regardless , we will take it .
[patient] i agree . i was very impressed with my triglycerides and was just wondering if the test may be what's helping .
[doctor] yeah , that's an unbelievable difference .
[patient] 145 milligrams per deciliter from 265 milligrams per deciliter is awesome . i also read that it- it's cardioprotective .
[doctor] absolutely .
[patient] my red blood cell count has increased .
[doctor] yeah , i saw that . it's fine though .
[patient] stable .
[doctor] your psa today is also , uh , is good also . it's , uh , .6 i think .
[patient] yeah . , is it ?
[doctor] yeah , it was .5 last year and anything under 4 is good .
[patient] nice , that's good news .
[doctor] so it just needs to be checked every year or so .
[patient] so in terms of , uh , estrogen control i've been hearing that indole-3-carbinol , or broccoli extract , supposedly can improve my estrogen levels . have you ever heard of it ?
[doctor] yeah , i've heard of it but i have n't had anybody consistently use it . i mean , your levels are fine and we checked your estra- estradiol and it was not elevated , so .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] i would argue that we could test that in the fall if you want , but we do n't need to do , uh , do any more tests ... any more than test once a year , excuse me .
[patient] okay , what about increasing my testosterone to 175 milligrams ? i'm at 140 now .
[doctor] well , your levels are high .
[patient] are they right now ?
[doctor] well , i mean they were last time .
[patient] yeah but i just- just injected though , or i had right before that was taken .
[doctor] i know . i know you had then , uh , when did you inject this time ?
[patient] i figure i'm on my eighth day today .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] so i'm due to dose on thursday or friday .
[doctor] all right .
[patient] i have a little med calendar and i put checks and ts on it . that helps me .
[doctor] that's a great idea . so look , the biggest issue i've seen , even if your levels today are around 700 , is that your peaks are getting greater than 1,500 , putting you at a higher chance of needing to come off due to blood thickness . and your risk will only astronomically go up the higher the dose that we go on .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] you look well , your levels are good and you're feeling well .
[patient] yeah , i'm feeling good .
[doctor] i'm going to be blunt . unfortunately this happens often where you're feeling good but you want to feel really good . i mean , i get it and this is why people get into problems with this stuff , right ? it's like , back in the day when it was n't prescribed by doctors and people would get it at gyms and stuff and they would take huge doses . and then they would have a heart attack at 50 .
[patient] yeah , they have to be taking a lot .
[doctor] likely they are taking more than testosterone , but still .
[patient] and they are taking stuff for a long time .
[doctor] true . but right now i would not change your dose .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] make sense ?
[patient] it does , i appreciate the discussion .
[doctor] no problem . what pharmacy are you using ? have you changed it or anything ?
[patient] no changes , i use walmart pharmacy . i do need more cialis and finasteride .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] i would prefer the paper prescription .
[doctor] for all of them ?
[patient] sure .
[doctor] all right , will do . i'm gon na get your prescriptions .

MEDICAL NOTE:

CHIEF COMPLAINT

Follow-up.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Nicole Miller is a 71-year-old female who presents for follow-up. The patient was called in for a follow up with me for chronic congestive heart failure with diastolic dysfunction. Her BNP had been 3000 in 03/2021, up to 6000 in 04/2021. She was increasingly dyspneic. We had changed her furosemide to torsemide at 20 mg by mouth daily. The patient is not on a potassium supplement currently. Her lisinopril had also been increased up to 10 mg daily in 03/2021.

I last saw her in 04/2021, and she had reported being interested in having her right knee replaced this summer at East Metropolitan Hospital, so it was recommended that we work to control her cardiovascular status prior to surgery. She is currently scheduled to have surgery on 06/24/2021. She plans to discontinue clopidogrel a week before her surgery.

The patient states that she has lost approximately 3 to 3.5 pounds since her last visit in 04/2021. Some of which may be water weight decreasing. She did report experiencing bilateral leg cramps which she treated with consumption of pickle juice, which did resolve the cramps. She thought the cramps were related to her being cold.

She is still taking iron supplementation. She denies any concerns with defecation.

Regarding her prior symptoms of heartburn, she denies any recent gastrointestinal issues. She notes that her heartburn was severe at one point but resolved after trying Prilosec for 2 weeks in 01/2021. She denies any issues with heartburn since that time and has stopped taking Prilosec altogether. She has since transitioned back to her original ""stomach medication"".

The patient is due for a colonoscopy. She is currently double covered with Medicare and private insurance.

PAST HISTORY

Medical
Chronic Congestive Heart Failure.
Iron deficiency Anemia.

Medications
Prilosec.

FAMILY HISTORY

No family history of colon cancer.

CURRENT MEDICATIONS

Torsemide 20 mg by mouth daily.
Lisinopril 10 mg daily.

RESULTS

Magnesium 1.7, hemoglobin WNL, potassium 3.9, creatinine 0.7, BUN 23.
03/2020 Hgb A1c 5.5.

ASSESSMENT

• Chronic congestive heart failure with mixed presentation.
• Preop examination.
• Diabetes mellitus.
• Colonoscopy

PLAN

Chronic congestive heart failure with mixed presentation.
She had an exacerbation of CHF earlier in the spring. We switched her from furosemide to torsemide and symptomatically, she is doing a lot better. She is about 1.5 kg down in weight. Her breathing is nonlabored. We are going to repeat an EKG today. Otherwise, continue her current regimen. Labs were checked and creatinine is appropriate. Her magnesium is below the preferred 2 at 1.7, with some occurrence of bilateral leg cramping, therefore we will start her on magnesium supplement.

Preop examination.
She is going to be having a right knee replacement at the end of 06/2021. We will schedule a preop check the first week or two of June prior to the surgery. She will discontinue clopidogrel for one week prior to knee replacement surgery; we will provide a reminder to patient of this as well.

Diabetes mellitus.
A1c is 5.5 on last check, so there is no need for a further A1c today. She may need another one prior to her surgery next month.

Colonoscopy.
The patient is overdue for a colonoscopy, which we will try to have done at County Hospital in the next month, prior to a change in her insurance. This is just a screening colonoscopy that she is overdue for. No family history of colon cancer.

The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.

INSTRUCTIONS

Complete EKG today. Schedule a preop checkup 1st or 2nd week of June. Start magnesium supplement. Call the clinic with any questions or new symptoms.","[doctor] next patient is nicole miller . date of birth is 09/18/1949 . patient was called for a follow-up with me for chronic congestive heart failure with diastolic dysfunction . bmp's been , uh , 3,000 in march , and is about six- was up to 6,000 in april . she was increasingly dyspneic . we changed her furosemide and torsemide 20 milligrams by mouth daily . uh to note , the patient is not currently on potassium supplement . her lisinopril had- has also been increased up to 10 milligrams daily in march . also did when i saw her last april . she reported being interested in having her right knee replaced this summer at east metro . it was recommended that we work to control her cardiovascular status before surgery .
[doctor] hey , miss miller , how are you today ?
[patient] i'm doing okay , thank you .
[doctor] i asked you to come in today because we want to keep- we want you to have this knee surgery this summer but we want to keep a close eye on you to make sure a week before your surgery you do n't suddenly go into congestive heart failure and it gets postponed .
[patient] yeah , that would not be good .
[doctor] i see you're scheduled on the 24th for surgery .
[patient] yeah , that's right .
[doctor] okay , good . well it looks like you have lost about 3 , 3 and a half pounds since i saw you last in april . some of that might be water weight , but still , this is positive .
[patient] yeah , i noticed that too . i think the oxyglutinine is helping as well . my urgency to use the bathroom is much better .
[doctor] well that's great .
[patient] yeah , i , i'm pleased about it too .
[doctor] you ever get leg or finger cramps or anything like that ?
[patient] yeah , i had leg cramps the other day , but i thought it might , was maybe just because i was cold as i had my ceiling fan on and fell asleep . i had cramps when i woke up in both legs right here . um i drank pickle juice and it went right away .
[doctor] well do n't , do n't get crazy with the pickle juice because all of the salt in it .
[patient] haha , i know , i only drink about 4 ounces or so .
[doctor] okay good .
[patient] um it went away so i did n't drink anymore . i find it works a lot better than trying to put some cream on my leg .
[doctor] sure just , just keep it in moderation .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] and then are you still on an iron supplement ? and are you using the bathroom okay ?
[patient] uh yes , everything is good .
[doctor] good . how is your heart burn doing ? any problems with that ?
[patient] no , it did get bad for a while so i tried to take some prilosec and then stopped that other one .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] um i did that for like , gosh , i think it was two weeks back in january and have n't had any problems since .
[doctor] great .
[patient] um and after i stopped taking that um i went back to the stomach one , so i'm doing good now .
[doctor] okay and you're still due for a colonoscopy , correct ?
[patient] uh yeah , that's right .
[doctor] all right , let's review your blood work real quick . i checked your hemoglobin level because you have had some anemia in the past but that is still doing great .
[patient] good , that's a relief to hear .
[doctor] your potassium is 3.9 so it's holding steady on the torsemide . your creatinine was .7 not .8 so you're doing well with kidney numbers . your bun may be a tiny bit elevated at 23 which is the number we look for for dehydration sometimes the kidneys , but it's not terrible . um so when i look at your numbers as a whole i think you're tolerating the torsemide okay at the current dose . i also sent out to look at the heart failure number- i sent to look at your heart failure number . there is a test called a bmp that i was monitoring and in march it was up to 3,000 and then went up to 6,000 in april before i made the change . i'm still waiting for those results .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] all in all i think you're doing good on paper though .
[patient] what about , um what's it called , a1c ? does that show up ?
[doctor] um i do n't think i ordered it but i could . your last a1c was 5.5 in march .
[patient] all righty .
[doctor] so your blood sugar is a little bit high , it was 169 today but that kind of depends on what you ate and you were n't fasting for the blood check so i might have to repeat that test for pre-op , but i do n't think we need to do it today .
[patient] all righty that sounds good .
[doctor] i checked your magnesium level because sometimes you uh urinate out magnesium with the water pills but it was normal at 1.7 and your blood pressure is also looking good .
[patient] okay great . that all sounds awesome .
[doctor] all right let's take a quick listen .
[doctor] use my general physical exam template .
[doctor] and take a couple of deep breaths for me .
[doctor] your lungs sound pretty good to me so keep doing what you're doing . um uh , like i said , i think you're doing good overall but let's just talk about a few things .
[patient] all righty .
[doctor] so we often like to keep people with heart problems on magnesium and get their levels up to around the 2-ish range . yours is a little bit less than 2 and we want that 2-ish range because it can help stabilize the heart muscle . so i might recommend putting you on magnesium supplement . it's supposed to be twice a day so that's kind of annoying , but i know you're on other medicines twice a day too , so i think you'll do fine .
[patient] yeah , that'll be okay .
[doctor] great . now before surgery we'll have to get you off your clopidogrel for a week beforehand .
[patient] yes , okay , i have everything written down on my phone , and i have a letter taped to the side of my bed to remind me .
[doctor] perfect ! we will give you a reminder as well . we will also need to complete a pre-op check within two weeks of your surgery during the first or second week of june .
[patient] okay , i'll put that down .
[doctor] you might also have to repeat an ekg before surgery which we could do today . i know i'm sure it feels like you're doing , you're always doing ekgs . um we do n't need to any x-rays of your chest because you had one recently , and we do n't need any more blood work because we did that today .
[patient] yeah , i do a lot of ekgs . i'm basically a regular . but i'm happy to do one today , no problem .
[doctor] lastly , once we get your knee surgery , um we , we should think about getting you a colonoscopy . we can do it here locally because you have medicare . do you have private insurance also ?
[patient] yeah , i have both .
[doctor] okay so yes , you can get it , your colonoscopy , wherever you'd like .
[patient] okay , well my husband's insurance may be running out . might we be able to get the procedure done sooner ? maybe in the next 30 days ? is that okay ?
[doctor] um i can put it in right now for , uh , for county for the next 30 days , and they might be able to get you in within the next few weeks . it should not take , it should not make you ineligible for the surgery . in other words completing a colonoscopy would not delay your surgery .
[patient] okay , good .
[doctor] so let me see . i've been doing one of two things at every one , and everyone is great so it depends more on timing availability of their or for the colonoscopy . we can send you to dr. martin for the surgery who is at county surgical services down here or the other option is valley medical , and they do it at springfield .
[patient] okay , that sounds good .
[doctor] i think either direction they're good technicians of the colon .
[patient] okay , yeah whatever you can get me in , that works great .
[doctor] so i'll call around . now if you get that done and they tell you 10 years then you'll be good to go .
[patient] great , thank you .
[doctor] you're welcome . have a great day . let us know if you need anything else , okay ?
[patient] sounds good .
[doctor] all right , assessment and plan .
[doctor] chronic chf . mixed presentation . had a exacerbation of cf , chf earlier in the spring . we switched her from a furosemide to torsemide and symptomatically she is doing a lot better . she's about 3 , 3 and a half pounds down in weight . breathing is non-labored . going to repeat ekg today but otherwise continue with her current regimen . labs checked and creatinine is appropriate .
[doctor] uh number 2 , pre-op examination . she is , she's having a right knee replacement end of june . also , she would like to have a colonoscopy performed which we'll try to have done at uh bartley regional , rightley regional hospital in the next month , uh , prior to a change in her insurance . this is just a screening colonoscopy that she is overdue for . no family history of colon cancer .
[doctor] uh the next one is diabetes . a1c is 5.1 on the last check so no need for further a1c today . she may need another one prior to her surgery next month though . thanks .",344.6,"Torsemide 20 mg by mouth daily.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Musculoskeletal: Patient reports left ankle pain.

VITALS

Vitals are slightly elevated due to pain level but are otherwise stable.

PHYSICAL EXAM

NEURO: Normal strength and sensation bilaterally.
MSK: Examination of the left ankle: Ecchymosis noted over the lateral malleolus. Edema is present. Tenderness to palpation laterally. No joint laxity appreciated. No bony tenderness to palpation of the foot. Capillary refill is brisk at less than 3 seconds bilaterally. Strong dorsalis pedis pulses bilaterally.

RESULTS

These reveal no fracture or bony abnormalities.

ASSESSMENT

Left ankle sprain of the lateral ligament complex.

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I have had a lengthy discussion with the patient in regards to his current symptoms. We discussed that his symptoms are consistent with an ankle sprain of the lateral ligament complex. The nature of the diagnosis and treatment options were discussed. At this time he will continue to follow the RICE protocol. He will continue to take NSAIDs as needed for pain and swelling. He will also be placed into an Aircast for ankle stabilization and will be provided crutches in order to remain non-weight-bearing. We discussed that it may be a few days before he feels able to tolerate walking. I also advised him that his symptoms will likely start to improve significantly over the next 4 to 6 days.

INSTRUCTIONS

The patient will follow up with me in 2 weeks to assess his progress, sooner if needed.

MEDICAL NOTE:

CHIEF COMPLAINT

Right ankle pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Carolyn Jones is a pleasant 38-year-old female who presents to the clinic today for evaluation of right ankle pain.

The patient sustained an injury to her right ankle when she slipped and fell on ice while taking her garbage out yesterday. This was her first right ankle injury. She believes she heard a pop at the time, but denies any associated numbness or tingling. Initially, she was unable to bear weight on the ankle and required help getting inside; however, she is now able to slightly bear weight but ambulates with an antalgic gait. Ice, elevation, and ibuprofen have been helpful at reducing her pain. She rates her current pain as 4/10, her pain without medication as 6/10, and her pain with medication as 1/10.

Of note, the patient participates in an intramural soccer league but has not been able to play since this injury.

MEDICAL HISTORY

The patient reports that she has had several ankle injuries in the past. This is her first right ankle injury.

SOCIAL HISTORY

The patient reports that she has a history of playing sports. She played soccer in college and is now in an intramural soccer league.

MEDICATIONS

The patient reports that she has been taking ibuprofen.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Musculoskeletal: Reports right ankle pain.
Neurological: Denies right ankle numbness or tingling.

VITALS

Normal

PHYSICAL EXAM

GAIT: antalgic gait
CV: Brisk capillary refill to less than 3 seconds. Strong dorsalis pedis pulse.
NEURO: Sensation in the right ankle is intact to light touch distally.
MSK: Examination of the right ankle: Ecchymosis over the lateral malleolus associated with trace edema in that area. Tenderness to palpation over the anterolateral soft tissue. No laxity on anterior drawer testing or inversion stress testing. No bony tenderness on palpation of the foot or ankle area. Findings are consistent bilaterally.

RESULTS

X-ray images of the right ankle were obtained and reviewed today. These reveal no evidence of fracture.

ASSESSMENT

Lateral ligament complex sprain, Right ankle.

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, her symptoms are consistent with a right ankle sprain of the lateral ligament complex, more specifically the anterior talofibular ligament. We had a lengthy discussion regarding the nature of this injury and the course of treatment. I advised her to keep her leg elevated when she is seated and continue to ice her ankle. She should also continue taking ibuprofen as-needed for pain and inflammation management. She will be placed in an Aircast to help stabilize her ankle, and I am going to order crutches so she can remain non-weight-bearing for the next couple of days. At that point, she can start bearing weight on the ankle as tolerated.

INSTRUCTIONS

The patient will follow up in 2 weeks.

MEDICAL NOTE:

CHIEF COMPLAINT

Right knee pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Virginia Phillips is a pleasant 53-year-old female who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of right knee pain. The onset of her pain began 7 days ago, when she was playing basketball and another player ran into her. She states that she fell to the ground and landed on her side. She denies hearing or feeling a pop at the time of the injury. The patient localizes her pain to the medial aspect of her knee. She used ice and an ACE wrap right after the injury. Today, she notes that she has been doing exercises, ice, and Mobic for pain control.

MEDICAL HISTORY

The patient reports she is a diabetic who takes her blood sugar every morning.

SOCIAL HISTORY

Patient reports that she plays basketball at the Y for fun.

MEDICATIONS

Patient reports that she takes metformin 500 mg twice a day.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Musculoskeletal: Reports right knee pain.

PHYSICAL EXAM

MSK: Examination of the right knee: No pain to palpation of the lateral aspect of the right knee. Pain with palpation on the medial aspect of the knee. Ecchymosis and swelling on the medial aspect of the knee. Effusion is appreciated. Decreased ROM. Negative varus and valgus stress test.

RESULTS

X-rays of the right knee taken in office today reveal the bony alignment in good position. There is no evidence of any fractures. There is effusion present.

ASSESSMENT

Right knee pain, possible medial collateral ligament strain.

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I have had a lengthy discussion with the patient in regard to her current symptoms. I have prescribed the patient meloxicam 15 mg once a day to treat the pain and swelling. She was advised to stop taking any anti-inflammatory such as Motrin or Advil. I have also recommended that the patient attend formal physical therapy to strengthen her right knee. I have also advised her to continue to use the ACE wrap and wear a right knee brace for a few days. She should continue light walking with her brace on. The patient was advised to stop basketball until she follows up in 7 days.

Regarding her diabetes, she should continue to monitor her blood sugars daily. She should reach out to her primary care physician if she sees an increase in her blood sugars due to loss of activity.

INSTRUCTIONS

The patient will follow up with me in 7 days to check on her progress. If her swelling has not improved, we will consider obtaining a CT or MRI of the right knee to evaluate for a possible medial collateral ligament strain.

---------------------------------------------","[doctor] hi virginia how're you today
[patient] i'm good thanks how are you
[doctor] good so you know you got that knee x-ray when you first came in but tell me a little bit about what happened
[patient] i was playing basketball and jerry ran into me and the inside of my knee hurts
[doctor] okay did you fall to the ground or did you just kinda plant and he pushed and you went one way and your knee did n't
[patient] i did fall to the ground
[doctor] you did fall to the ground okay and did you land on the kneecap i mean did it hurt a lot were you able to get up and continue on
[patient] i landed on my side i was not able to continue on
[doctor] okay so you get off the off the court is jerry a good player you just got ta ask that question
[patient] not really
[doctor] no
[patient] he does n't have much game
[doctor] okay okay well you know i love basketball i'm a little short for the game but i absolutely love to watch basketball so it's really cool that you're out there playing it so tell me about a little bit about where it hurts
[patient] on the inside
[doctor] on the inside of it okay and after the injury did they do anything special for you or you know did you get ice on it right away or try anything
[patient] i had ice and an ace wrap
[doctor] you had ice and what
[patient] an ace wrap
[doctor] and an ace wrap okay now how many days ago was this exactly
[patient] seven
[doctor] seven days ago okay yeah your right knee still looks a little swollen for seven days ago so i'm gon na go ahead and now i also see that you're diabetic and that you take five hundred milligrams of metformin twice a day are you still you're still on that medication is that correct
[patient] correct
[doctor] and do you check your blood sugars every morning at home
[patient] every morning
[doctor] okay great and since this i'm the reason i'm asking all these questions i'm a little concerned about the inactivity with your your knee pain and you know how diabetes you need to be very you know active and and taking your medicine to keep that under control so you know may wan na continue to follow up with your pcp for that diabetes as we go through here and just watch your blood sugars extra as we go through that now i'm gon na go ahead and examine your your right knee and when i push on the outside does that hurt at all
[patient] no
[doctor] okay and when i push on this inside where it's a little swollen does that hurt
[patient] yes
[doctor] yeah okay i'm just gon na ask a question did you hear or feel a pop in your knee when you were doing this
[patient] i did not no
[doctor] you did not okay okay what are you doing for the pain today
[patient] some exercises ice and mobic
[doctor] okay okay so i'm gon na continue all of my exam when i go ahead and pull on your knee the first thing i'm looking at is i do see some ecchymosis and swelling on the inside of that right knee and when i push around that knee i can see that there is fluid in the knee a little bit of fluid in the knee we call that effusion so i can appreciate some of that effusion and that could be either fluid or blood at this point from the injury that you had now you do have pain with palpation on the medial aspect of that right knee and that's that's concerning for me when i'm gon na just i just wan na move your knee a little bit it does n't look like when i extend it and flex it that you have a full range of motion does it hurt a lot when i moved it back a little more than normal
[patient] yes it hurts
[doctor] okay okay yeah so you do have some decreased range of motion in that right knee now i'm just gon na sit here and and lay you back and i'm gon na pull on your knee and twist your knee a little bit okay you currently there is a negative varus and valgus stress test that's really important so here's what i'm thinking for that right knee i think you have may have a medial collateral ligament strain from you know maybe the twisting motion be right before you fell to the ground i want you to continue to use an ace wrap i'm gon na give you a right knee brace we're gon na wear that for a few days and then i'm gon na send you to physical therapy so we can continue strengthening the muscles around the right knee now that x-ray as far as the x-ray results that x-ray that i did it this morning in the office the the bony alignment's in good position i do n't see any evidence of any fractures i do notice the the effusion around the right knee just a small amount of fluid but we're just gon na continue to watch that i'm gon na give you a prescription i'd like you to stop taking any of the nonsteroidals that you're taking the motrin or advil whichever one of those and i'm gon na give you meloxicam fifteen milligrams and i want you to take that daily for the pain and swelling i want you to just continue exercising with the the braces and everything on so if you can you can get out and do some light walking that'll be good and then again for your diabetes like i said just continue to watch those blood sugars daily and if you start to see any significant increase in them because of your loss of activity just reach out to your primary care physician now do you have any questions for me
[patient] when can i play basketball again
[doctor] yeah that's a great question i'm gon na ask well my first off i want to see you back here in in seven days you know in a week i want you to make an appointment we're gon na relook at it we're gon na determine if that swelling got any worse and if we need to go on to potentially ordering like a cat scan or an mri of that knee to look and see if there was any significant damage to the ligament so that's for for sure for seven days you're not gon na be playing basketball now are you in a ligue or is that just you get like pick up basketball
[patient] i just played the wife with fun
[doctor] okay okay good that's a great activity like i said i wish i could play now i i also know your your family do n't they own that sports store down right off a main street that sells a lot of sporting equipment

An echocardiogram, obtained at an outside facility, was reviewed today. It demonstrates a preserved ejection fraction of 55%. Normal diastolic filling. Mild to moderate mitral regurgitation.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

1. CHF.
- Medical Reasoning: The patient’s recent epsiode resulting in the emergency room visit was likely caused by his dietary indiscretion and uncontrolled hypertension that we have been monitoring.
- Patient Education and Counseling: I reviewed the echocardiogram results with the patient and discussed the importance of following dietary restrictions. I encouraged the patient to take his medication on a consistent basis. I advised him to purchase a scale to weigh himself daily.
- Medical Treatment: He will continue Bumex 2 mg once daily. He was provided with a referral to a nutritionist in consultation for further assistance with his dietary requirements to lower his sodium intake.

Age: 79.0
Gender: male
Chief Complaint: Right foot ulcer
Secondary Complaints: Diabetes;Coronary artery disease

---------------------------------------------
MEDICAL NOTE:

CHIEF COMPLAINT

Right foot ulcer.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Jeremy Roberts is a 79-year-old male who presents today for evaluation of a right foot ulcer. He reports an ulcer on his right foot has been present for approximately 6 to 8 weeks. He first noticed the ulcer after working outside. There is no associated pain, however, he feels the ulcer may have worsened from when he first noticed it. He denies experiencing any fevers or chills. He does however experience tension headaches quite frequently. He denies any pain in his calves when he walks. At this time the patient does not have a podiatrist for yearly foot exams.

He is a diabetic and takes insulin. His blood sugar has been running higher than normal and his last hemoglobin A1c was higher than 9. Occasionally he will also experience numbness and tingling in his feet, especially with colder weather.

In terms of his heart disease, the patient sustained a heart attack in 2018 and underwent stent placement at the right coronary artery. He is currently taking aspirin 81 mg daily. He denies chest pain or shortness of breath.

MEDICAL HISTORY

Patient reports history of diabetes and heart disease. He sustained a heart attack in 2018.

SURGICAL HISTORY

Patient reports undergoing stent placement at the right coronary artery.

SOCIAL HISTORY

Patient reports he is a former smoker. He previously smoked 2 packs a day for 20 years and was able to stop smoking approximately 4 years ago. Currently he is not very active but he does work around the house.

MEDICATIONS

Patient reports taking aspirin 81 mg daily and insulin.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Constitutional: Denies fevers and chills.
Cardiovascular: Denies chest pain.
Respiratory: Denies dyspnea.
Skin: Patient reports right foot ulcer.
Neurological: Patient reports headaches and numbness and tingling in feet.

VITALS

No fever.
Blood pressure: 127/80
Heart rate: 60s

PHYSICAL EXAM

CV: 2/6 systolic ejection murmur heard at the left base.
RESPIRATORY: Clear to auscultation bilaterally
NECK: No jugular venous distention or carotid bruits
MSK: Examination of the right lower extremity: No palpable dorsalis pedis or posterior tibial pulses. There is a 2 x 3 cm ulcerated lesion on the right lateral foot near the 5th metacarpal metatarsophalangeal joint. No associated cellulitis. No pain to palpation of the right foot. There is associated granulation tissue and some slight purulent discharge from the wound.

ASSESSMENT

1. Non-healing ulcer, right foot
2. Diabetes
3. Coronary artery disease

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination findings today, I have had a lengthy discussion with the patient in regards to his current symptoms. We discussed that his right foot ulcer is fairly sizable and will require wound care. I advised him that the ulcer does not appear to be healing and that further studies will be needed to assess if he has adequate blood supply to heal his foot wound. He was advised that due to his diabetes it is possible surgical intervention such as stent placement or bypass surgery may be required to improve his blood supply. I also advised him that I believe we will be able to heal his wound. At this time, I have recommended continued wound care and for him to also continue taking aspirin 81 mg daily. We will order an arterial ultrasound of the lower extremities. He will also be referred to podiatry for a consult.

Regarding his diabetes, this appears to be unstable as the patient reports his last hemoglobin a1c was greater than 9 and is now experiencing a non-healing right foot ulcer. We discussed the importance of blood sugar control as this will impact his wound healing. At this time, I have recommended that he follow-up with his primary care physician for further care.

The patient's coronary artery disease is currently stable. It is recommended that he continue to take his statin as prescribed. I will contact his cardiologist for medical clearance should surgical intervention be required for his non-healing right foot ulcer.

---------------------------------------------","[doctor] hi jeremy how are you
[patient] i'm really good thank you how are you
[doctor] i'm okay the the medical assistant told me that you had this ulcer on your foot that's been there for a couple of weeks
[patient] yes
[doctor] going away
[patient] yeah it's been there gosh it's like six or so weeks right now and it's and it's on my right foot and it's just yeah it's just not going away i'm not sure if it maybe even gotten a little worse from when i first noticed it
[doctor] okay and how long did you say it's going on for
[patient] probably about
[doctor] six eight weeks maybe
[patient] okay and do you have any pain in your foot no no no pain at all okay now i know that you're a diabetic and you are on some insulin have your sugars been running okay yeah they have been running
[doctor] okay
[patient] you know on the most part they seem to be running a little higher than normal
[doctor] your sugars are running higher than normal okay do you recall what your last hemoglobin a1c was was it above nine
[patient] yes it it it definitely was higher than nine
[doctor] okay alright now what do you think caused this ulcer were you wearing some tight fitting shoes or did you have some trauma to your foot or
[patient] yeah i was you know i think initially i'm you know i was out in the backyard you know kind of you know doing some work and you know i know i you know i could've stepped on a nail or you know there was some other work but you know i'm always outside so i do n't know if that kind of led to anything or caused anything
[doctor] okay alright and have you had any fever or chills
[patient] no no no fever or chills you know i kinda you know get headaches pretty often i do n't know if that you know i do n't know if that's a stress or but you know always have like the tension headaches in the front
[doctor] okay and do you have do you have neuropathy where you get like numbing and tingling in your feet
[patient] occasionally yeah occasionally especially when it's like colder outside
[doctor] mm-hmm kinda feels like it takes a little longer to
[patient] warm up but yeah i kinda have some sensation in in all my extremities
[doctor] okay alright and then are you are you a smoker or did you smoke
[patient] i did back you know kind of years ago i did but yeah i have n't smoked anything in in good number of years
[doctor] okay alright when did you stop smoking
[patient] couple years ago maybe four or so years ago
[doctor] okay alright and how many packs a day would you smoke
[patient] gosh back then yeah was at least two
[doctor] okay alright how many years did you smoke for like twenty
[patient] yeah at least twenty yeah twenty plus years
[doctor] okay alright now any other symptoms do you have any problems when you walk down the street do you get any pain in your calves at all when you walk
[patient] no no no no pain you know just kind of you know it's just i know that it's there
[doctor] okay and you said you're active you're out in the yard and things like that do you go on long walks at all or no
[patient] no no you know it's you know i just kinda feel like i've been just trying to take it easy lately
[doctor] mm-hmm
[patient] but yeah most most of the stuff i've been doing is just kind of hanging around the house
[doctor] okay alright so we talked a little bit about your diabetes let's talk about your heart disease now your heart disease you had a heart attack in twenty eighteen we put a stent into your right coronary artery you're still taking your medications for that you're still on your aspirin
[patient] i am yes yeah i do the baby aspirin every day
[doctor] okay alright and any chest pain or shortness of breath or anything like that no no yeah no nothing more than yeah i would n't attribute anything
[patient] okay and do you have a podiatrist for your yearly foot exams
[doctor] no i i i do n't okay alright alright well let's go ahead i wan na just do a quick physical exam i'm just gon na be calling out some of my exam findings so your vital signs here in the office you do n't have any fever so that's good your blood pressure is great it's like one twenty seven over eighty and your heart rate is nice and slow in the sixties on your neck exam i do n't appreciate any jugular venous distention or any carotid bruits on your lung exam your lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally on your heart exam you do have a two out of six systolic ejection murmur heard at the left base and on your lower extremity exam i do n't appreciate any palpable dorsalis pedis or posterior tibial pulses there is a two by three centimeter ulcerated lesion on the right lateral foot near the fifth metacarpal metatarsophalangeal joint there is no associated cellulitis does it hurt when i press here
[patient] no
[doctor] there is no pain to palpation of the right foot there is associated granulation tissue and some slight purulent discharge from the wound okay so what does all that mean that just means that you have this ulcer that's you know fairly sizable with i think we need to do some good wound care on it let's talk a little bit about my assessment and plan so you know i you have a nonhealing ulcer of your right foot so we need to do some studies on you to see if you have an adequate blood supply to heal this foot wound and since you since you probably do n't because of your diabetes you're here in a vascular surgeon's office we may have to go ahead and talk about being able to open up some of your arteries to improve the blood supply to your foot so that might mean getting a stent to one of your arteries in your legs to open up the blood supply it might mean mean that we might have to do some bypass surgery to to improve the blood supply to your foot in order to heal that that wound i do think that you'll be able to heal it i do n't think that we need to do anything drastic i want you to continue with your aspirin because that will help
[patient] any questions
[doctor] yeah i mean is this do we have to do any more tests or anything what are you we're gon na do an arterial ultrasound i'm going to go ahead and order an arterial ultrasound of your lower extremities to see what the blood supply is like and then i'm gon na go ahead and order a podiatry consult because i want them to see this wound and improve the wound care that you're doing and then for your next problem your diabetes i wan na go ahead and talk to your primary care physician we need to get your diabetes better controlled because that impacts your wound healing as well okay
[patient] sure
[doctor] sure understood alright and for your last issue your coronary artery disease continue with your statin and i will talk to your cardiologist in case you need a procedure to see if you're cleared from a medical standpoint okay
[patient] okay perfect
[doctor] alright
[patient] perfect thank you so much

---------------------------------------------","[doctor] hi virginia how are you today what brings you in
[patient] i'm doing alright i started seeing this new pcp last year and you know she has been doing a lot of changes to my medication and making sure everything is up to date and she my noticed that my blood pressure has been quite high so she added to medications but and but i you know i've been taking them i've been really good and i i before i was n't but now i am and we're still having a hard time controlling my blood pressure so she thought it would be a good idea for me to see you especially since she noted some on my last blood work she said something about my kidneys
[doctor] okay yeah so okay let's before i dive into a lot of that tell me a little bit about how you've been feeling
[patient] i would say you know most of the days i feel fine i'm still busy at work i definitely can tell though when my blood pressure is high
[doctor] okay you measure it at home you you you measure your blood pressure at home
[patient] yeah i she wanted me to get a blood pressure cuff so i did start getting checking my blood pressures probably like a few times a week
[doctor] okay
[patient] and so then i noticed that it has been getting higher the other day was even as high as one seventy over ninety
[doctor] wow
[patient] so i did call my pcp and she increased the meds again
[doctor] yeah okay now i i just have a couple questions about that are you using a an electronic blood pressure recorder or do you have somebody help you at home
[patient] yeah she i have a a electronic one an electronic arm one
[doctor] okay okay yeah that's good that's good and have you ever tried do you go to cvs at all
[patient] yeah i i do but i've noticed like since the pandemic i do n't see the blood pressures anymore
[doctor] okay okay yeah i i thought the one down on main street they i thought they just brought that one back so
[patient] did they
[doctor] yeah
[patient] that's good to know
[doctor] you may wan na check that but okay so that's good but i what i'd like you to do with that is i'd like you to keep a record of them for me for my next visit with you so let's talk a little bit about your diet tell me how how is your diet what what are the what kind of foods do you like what do you eat normally
[patient] alright do you want the honest answer
[doctor] well yeah that would be better
[patient] so i really you know with everything going on i really been trying to get better but i mean during football season it's really difficult i really love watching my games so have a lot of pizza wings subs like i said i've been trying to cut down especially on days where there is no games but it probably could be better
[doctor] okay i think we all can say that but i do wan na just hey i do n't know that if you've tried it or not but there is a new restaurant down on fifth street and it is nothing but solids and i you know when i heard this i was like okay yeah it's just another these solids are absolutely amazing so if you ever get a chance yeah if you ever get a chance try try that i mean i think you would enjoy them because they're salads that they make are just out unbelievable so let me go ahead and i just have a few more questions and i'm gon na just ask these in in order and you just tell me and then we will come back and talk about them do you have any headaches
[patient] really just when my blood pressure gets really high i have some mild headaches but otherwise i do n't have it on a regular basis
[doctor] okay what about chest pain
[patient] no chest pain
[doctor] shortness of breath
[patient] no shortness of breath
[doctor] even with exertion
[patient] even with exertion
[doctor] okay do you have any swelling in your lower extremities at all that you noticed
[patient] not if i'm on my feet for a long time i'll notice a little bit of swelling but otherwise no
[doctor] okay and then a couple other family history questions anybody in the family have kidney disease or significant high blood pressure
[patient] both my parents do have high blood pressure and one of them did have kidney disease
[doctor] okay okay and in the the the form that you filled out when you came in it says that you are on ten milligrams of norvasc daily and carvedilol twenty five milligrams twice a day is those the medicines you're on
[patient] yes i was also on lisinopril before but with the adjustments yeah those are the ones i'm on
[doctor] okay and so here's where i think we are going to go do you take any nonsteroidals like advil or motrin or aleve
[patient] yeah just once in a while for my like any knee pain or back pain that i have but again not like everyday
[doctor] okay and then lastly what kind of alcohol intake do you have you know do you consider how many drinks a week is really what i'm looking for
[patient] i'll have a couple of beers during the week and like one or two on the weekends
[doctor] okay okay so lem me do a quick physical examination so i looked at your vitals when you came in today and your blood pressure it's still high it's one sixty nine over seventy four your heart rate was eighty eight and your oxygenation was ninety eight percent so those are all fairly good except that blood pressure's a little higher than we'd like to see now when i look at your neck i do n't see any jugular vein distention and i'm gon na listen here real quick no i do n't hear any carotid bruits i'm gon na listen to your lungs okay your lungs are clear and let me listen quickly to your heart i do hear that a two over six systolic ejection murmur and we'll we're gon na have to take a little bit look extra look at that that's when i i can hear an extra sound when i'm listening to your heart and you do have a small amount of one plus pitting edema bilaterally now i did so you do have that your diagnosis is uncontrolled hypertension you know and i think you're aware that that's what your your physician's been treating you for and most of the time this cause is is the cause of this is multifactorial it's not that there is just one thing causing it so we may need to be changing your medicine around and i'm gon na talk to your doctor but first thing before we make any more medication changes i want to order some tests first to rule out if there is any specific cause for this so first order will be a renal artery ultrasound and what i'm looking for there is that there is no areas of areas of narrowing in the the blood vessels of your kidneys that would be the cause of your hypertension in addition to that i'm gon na order a you get another urine collection some morning aldosterone levels reining levels and a twenty four hour urine and these things can really show me if there is any problems with your adrenal glands again this is a lot of big words but you know i'm i i'll write this all out for you i want you to decrease your alcohol i know you like those beers but let's bring it down to maybe one a week or two a week just to get those down lower and then your salt intake you need to be very judicious about decreasing that salt intake i'm gon na give you a referral to a nutritionist to discuss those changes for that you need and and they will help you get that cleared up and then finally stop taking any nonsteroidal medicines such as your advil or motrin the only thing i really want to want you taking is tylenol for any pain right now i am gon na prescribe one medicine and that's cardura four milligrams and i want you to take that once a day and that's good to see if that can help us with your blood pressure and then finally three weeks i'd like you to return i want you to record all of your blood pressures that you take over the next three weeks and bring them into the office but most importantly if you can try to take them at the same time everyday that would be beneficial for me any questions for me
[patient] no i i just it's a lot so i i'm hoping this will work and this will get it under control
[doctor] yeah i i think you know this will be you know this we're gon na spend some time together so i'm glad to have you as a patient but you know we got ta try to get this under control and i'm gon na i'll be talking to your pcp just to let them know that you know what my plans are and we'll stay real in sync on treating this as we move forward does that sound like a plan

MEDICAL NOTE:

CHIEF COMPLAINT

Left arm pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

He reports that his left arm pain began approximately 2 weeks ago. He woke around 2:00 am with intense pain in his left arm and hand. He applied ice and after 2-3 hours, the pain improved and he was able to go back to sleep, the pain did not return until that evening. After several nights of experiencing the left arm and hand pain, he was seen by Betty Ross, PA-C. She suspected a pinched nerve and completed x-rays of the cervical spine, prescribed gabapentin and prednisone, and referred the patient to us. The patient has benefited from the gabapentin and prednisone, reporting improvement of pain at night.

The pain initially was encountered at night, but the patient notes that the symptoms carry into the next day. He denies pain when moving his neck, turning his head, and moving his shoulder.

Mr. Clark does report a history of a left finger injury, stating “it rarely works”, and neuropathy in one leg from his knee to his foot which he receives 1% disability for. The patient is a veteran.

PAST HISTORY

Medical
Peripheral neuropathy.

SOCIAL HISTORY

The patient is a veteran and receives 1% disability.

CURRENT MEDICATIONS

Gabapentin tablet.
Prednisone tablet.

PHYSICAL EXAM

Constitutional
Elderly Caucasian male in no apparent distress. Presents in wheelchair.

Neurologic
Upper extremities: 1+ bilateral biceps, triceps, brachioradialis, reflexes bilaterally, negative. Negative Hoffman's
Gait: Not assessed today.

Strength
Upper extremities: Normal throughout the biceps, triceps, deltoid, grip strength, and finger abduction, bilaterally.
Sensation: Intact to light touch throughout the upper and lower extremities.

Musculoskeletal
Cervical: Nontender over cervical spine. Mildly restricted cervical extension and right and left lateral rotation, which is symmetric, which gives him mild lateral neck pain, but no radicular pain. Spurling's maneuver is benign.

RESULTS

X-ray Cervical Spine, 06/04/2021.
Impression: Significant disc degeneration at C5-6 and to a lesser extent C4-5 and C3-4. Significant lower facet arthropathy. C6-7 and C7-T1 are difficult to visualize in the current x-rays.

ASSESSMENT

• Left upper extremity neuropathy, suspicious for cervical radiculopathy, possible contribution of peripheral neuropathy
• Neck pain in the setting of arthritis and disc generation

PLAN

I suspect that this is a flare of cervical radiculopathy. I am going to set him up for a cervical MRI. We will tentatively plan for a left C7-T1 epidural afterwards, although the exact level will be pending the MRI results. He will continue his home exercise program as well as twice daily gabapentin. We will follow up with him afterwards to determine his level of relief. He denies any blood thinners.

This plan was discussed in detail with the patient who is in agreement.

INSTRUCTIONS

Continue home exercise program and twice daily gabapentin. Schedule MRI and epidural injection. Follow-up after epidural.

[patient] um . i went back to sleep but for several nights this happened , like , over and over . so , i finally went to see the doctor , and i do n't really recall her name .
[doctor] okay . yeah , i think i know who you're talking about , though .
[patient] um , she's the one who sent me to you , so , i , i would , i would think so . but when i went to her after the third time it happened and she checked me out , she said it was most likely coming from a pinched nerve .
[doctor] probably . uh , do you notice that moving your neck or turning your head seems to bother your arm ?
[patient] uh , no .
[doctor] okay . is moving your shoulder uncomfortable at all ?
[patient] no .
[doctor] and do you notice it at other times besides during the night ?
[patient] um , some days . if it bothers me at night , then the day following , it usually will bother me some .
[doctor] okay . and do you just notice it in the hand , or does it seem to be going down the whole arm ?
[patient] well , it starts there and goes all the way down the arm .
[doctor] okay . have you noticed any weakness in your hand at all ?
[patient] uh , yes .
[doctor] okay . like , in terms of gripping things ?
[patient] yeah .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] uh , this finger , i hurt it some time ago as well .
[doctor] really ?
[patient] yeah . it does n't work properly . or , it works very rarely .
[doctor] gotcha . and did i hear that she gave you some prednisone and some oral steroids , or ?
[patient] uh , well , she gave me some numbing medicine . it helped a little bit . the other two were a neck pill and gabapentin . uh , you should have my full list in your notes , though . since then it has n't really bothered me at night . also , just so you know , i am a va and i'm one percent disabled from this leg , um , issues from my knees down to my feet .
[doctor] okay . is it neuropathy ?
[patient] uh , yep .
[doctor] gotcha . that is good to know . all right , well , let's go ahead and take a look .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] all right . so , to start , i'm gon na have you do something for me . uh , just go ahead and tilt your chin as far as you can down to your chest . okay , good . and now , go the other way , tilting your chin up as far as you can . now , does that seem to bother you at all ? okay . and now , come back to normal , just look and turn your head as far as you can that way . great . and now , as far as you can towards that wall . uh , does that seem to bother you at all ?
[patient] no . well , actually , i do feel a little strain .
[doctor] okay . so , you feel it in the neck a little bit ?
[patient] yeah , just a little strain .
[doctor] okay . uh , now squeeze my fingers as hard as you can with both hands . great . now , hold your arms like this .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] and i'm going to try to strain your arms and try to keep them as stiff as you can . do n't let me strain it . okay , good . good . now , when i , i'm just touching your hands like this . does it seem to feel about the same in both hands ?
[patient] uh , yes .
[doctor] okay . all right . so , i do agree with betty . uh , more than likely , this seems like it would be coming from your neck . that's the most common reason that causes what , what you're experiencing . and i looked at an x-ray of your neck , and you do seem to have a lot of arthritis there , and there does seem to be potential for a disc to be pushing on a nerve . and now , what i do n't have is an mri , which would show me , uh , kind of exactly where the nerve roots are getting pinched off .
[patient] i see .
[doctor] so , gabapentin can help a little bit with the nerve pain , and what i would like to do is potentially set you up for an epidural . and what that is is it , it's a focused anti-inflammatory medicine , excuse me , that works behind the nerve roops that , nerve roots that we are thinking might be getting squished off . it can often help alleviate your symptoms , and i do need to get an mri of your neck . um , i know we have had one of your lower back , but i need one of your neck to see exactly where the roots are getting pinched off . so , what i can do is tentatively set you up for an epidural , but before you do that , we do need to get that mri so i can see right where i need to put the medicine for your epidural . uh , what do you think of that ?
[patient] i think that sounds good to me .
[doctor] okay , good . and just to confirm , do you take any blood thinners ? i do n't think i saw any on your medicine list .
[patient] uh , no , i do n't .
[doctor] okay , good . and what i would have you do is continue with the gabapentin . um , are you taking 300 or 100 ?
[patient] um , not sure . my lady friend helps me handle this stuff .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] i am taking eliquis , though .
[doctor] okay . um , so whatever you are doing you can just keep doing it , and i'm going to set you up for the epidural and imaging study , um , just so i know right where to put the medicine . and i will follow up with you after s- um , that's in . we can do the shot , just to make sure your arm is feeling better . sound good ?
[patient] sounds good . for the last couple of nights , though , my neck has not been bothering me .
[doctor] okay . s- um , so , presumably what's happening , then , is when you're sleeping your neck is kind of gets off-tilt , uh , kilter , and it compresses the nerve roots there . now , if you think you're doing fine , we could hold off , but at the very la- least , i'd like to update that mri of yours and see what's going on , because probably this is something that will likely flare up again .
[patient] yeah , it , it has been for the last week , so , i understand .
[doctor] okay . all right . well , do you want to do that work-up and do the epidural , or do you think you're doing fine and you want to wait ?
[patient] well , my hand is still bothering me .
[doctor] okay . so , you're saying your neck is not bothering you but the hand is . okay . so then , let's just stick with the plan . mri of the neck , so we can see where the nerve roots may be compressed , that's giving your hand the issue . and then , we're going to set you up with the epidural .
[patient] okay . sounds good .
[doctor] all right . so , keep going with the gabapentin . i will order the imaging of your neck , and the shot will hopefully help some with those symptoms in your hand , and then we'll follow up afterwards .
[patient] all right . is the mri today ?
[doctor] um , you probably ca n't do it today , but let me talk with roy and see how soon we can get it done . just give me a quick minute , and then roy will come in and get things scheduled as soon as we can .

MEDICAL NOTE:

CHIEF COMPLAINT

Smoking cessation.

MEDICAL HISTORY

Patient reports a history of type 2 diabetes, gout, and a 2/6 Systolic ejection murmur.

SOCIAL HISTORY

Patient reports he is a smoker.

MEDICATIONS

Patient reports taking allopurinol.

VITALS

Oxygen Saturation: 98% on room air.
Blood Pressure: 128/88 mmHg.
Heart Rate: 68 beats per minute.
Respiratory Rate: 16 breaths per minute.

PHYSICAL EXAM

Neck
- General Examination: Neck is supple without lymphadenopathy. No carotid bruits.

Respiratory
- Auscultation of Lungs: Clear bilaterally. No expiratory wheezes, rales, or rhonchi.

Cardiovascular
- Auscultation of Heart: Regular rate. 2/6 systolic ejection murmur.

Hematology/Lymphatic/Immunology
- Palpation: No enlarged lymph nodes.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

1. Nicotine dependence.
- Medical Reasoning: The patient has a long history of smoking cigarettes. He is currently smoking 1.5 packs per day. He is highly motivated to cease smoking as he is preparing to become a father.
- Patient Education and Counseling: I applaud the patient on making this first step to stop smoking. I reassured him that with absolute 100% certainty that I will be with him every step of the way. I explained to the patient that stress can often be a trigger for smoking. He received handouts today for common smoking triggers. I advised him to be watchful and monitor his stress level, not only regarding work, but also his impending fatherhood. The patient and I discussed coping mechanisms for when he encounters stressful situations. I encouraged him to maintain his gym routine, engage in meditation, and try adding in yoga to help further reduce his stress levels. We discussed additional cessation aids.
- Medical Treatment: The patient has chosen his birthday, as a quit date. On that day, I am going to start him with a 21 mg nicotine patch, and the goal will be to decrease that over time. We will work together to decrease the dosage of the nicotine patch, so there are not necessarily any hard dates in mind. I recommend he change the patch location each day as that will help reduce or avoid any skin irritation that can occur if he re-uses the same location repeatedly.

2. Type 2 diabetes.
- Medical Reasoning: Stable.
- Patient Education and Counseling: We discussed that continuing to follow a healthy diet and perform regular exercise will help to maintain his blood glucose levels.
- Medical Treatment: We will continue to monitor his type 2 diabetes. Hemoglobin A1c is ordered to be completed by his next visit in 2 weeks.

3. History of gout.
- Medical Reasoning: Stable with medication.
- Patient Education and Counseling: I advised him to continue to watch for foods that will exacerbate his uric acid levels.
- Medical Treatment: He will continue his allopurinol.

Patient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.

INSTRUCTIONS

I would like to see him again in 2 weeks to discuss how things are going and to reevaluate the nicotine patch dosage.

MEDICAL NOTE:

CHIEF COMPLAINT

Right hip pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Elizabeth Reyes is a 56-year-old female who presents for the evaluation of pain in her right hip and groin region. Her symptoms started on 02/2020 and has progressively worsened. She is employed as an RN and notes that her symptoms began while she was working and walking around the infusion room at Johnson. Initially the pain would only happen when she took a step back, but the pain has progressed and now occurs with any type of movement involving her right hip and groin. She describes that her hip will sometimes “catch” when she moves, causing her to fall on occasion. The pain improves when she is still and stops moving. She rates her pain as 2-7/10.

Starting in 2018, the patient intentionally lost 110 pounds through Weight Watchers. She has maintained the weight loss and her weight has been stabile for the past 1 year. She has a history of several bulging discs, but the pain has significantly reduced due to her weight loss. Today, she reports no back pain.

She denies fever, chills, new onset of bowel or bladder dysfunction, tingling or numbness.

Pleasant.

Integumentary
Skin is in tact.

Musculoskeletal
Extremities: No bilateral ankle edema or calf tenderness.
Examination of gait: Heel-walk and toe-walk are intact.
Cervical spine exam: No tenderness is elicited. Range of motion is full in all planes without pain. Spurling's test is negative.
Lumbar spine exam: Range of motion is decreased in extension and lateral flexion without pain. No tenderness is elicited in the midline.
Sacroiliac joint exam: Bilateral sacroiliac joints are nontender to palpation.
Bilateral hip exam: Range of motion is decreased in the right hip with pain in the groin on internal and external rotation. Resisted right hip flexion causes pain in the right groin region. Bilateral trochanteric regions are nontender to palpation.

Neurological
Motor bulk and tone are normal in both lower extremities. Motor strength testing reveals no focal motor weakness in the lower extremities. Deep tendon reflexes are 1+ throughout. No focal sensory deficit is noted.

RESULTS

MR arthrogram of the right hip completed on 06/03/2021 reveals evidence of high-grade chondromalacia involving the anterosuperior right acetabulum with subchondral marrow edema and cyst formation.

ASSESSMENT

• Right hip degenerative joint disease.

PLAN

I discussed the clinical and radiological findings with the patient. Treatment options discussed are low impact exercises, use of analgesics as needed, and use of a cane to offload the right hip. She would like to proceed with a cortisone injection into her right hip joint. We will administer the injection today. I reviewed the procedure in detail, including the risks of the injection related to the use of steroid in the COVID setting. She understands the risks and would like to proceed with the injection.

INSTRUCTIONS

Schedule a follow up appointment in 3 months to assess her pain. If needed, a second injection may be administered.","[doctor] good morning ms. reyes !

[patient] okay .
[doctor] and we do have some options . so first is to start some low impact exercises . i can provide you with a hand out with what exercises you can do . you should take nsaids as needed to help with the pain and discomfort , as well as use of a cane to help offload the right side . a cane will help support your painful side to help reduce the pain .
[patient] hmm , i do n't love that idea but i'll give it a try .
[doctor] okay , that would be great . and we can also try a cortisone injection into the right hip joint to see if that offers any relief .
[patient] i would like to definitely get the injection .
[doctor] okay . we can take care of that today while you're here and then schedule a follow up appointment in three months to see how you're doing , and then receive another injection if needed .
[patient] okay , that sounds good .
[doctor] okay . and here are the risks associated with getting the inje- injection . um , please just take a moment to review it and consent to the shot .

SOCIAL HISTORY

Patient reports enjoying walking outside, gardening, and nature photography.

MEDICATIONS

Patient reports taking aspirin 81 mg daily, Brilinta 90 mg twice a day, Lipitor 80 mg daily, Toprol 50 mg daily, and lisinopril 20 mg a day.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Constitutional: Reports fatigue. Denies changes in sleep.
Cardiovascular: Denies chest pain.
Respiratory: Denies shortness of breath.
Musculoskeletal: Denies lower extremity swelling.

VITALS

Vital signs look good today.

PHYSICAL EXAM

Neck
- General Examination: No carotid bruits.

Respiratory
- Auscultation of Lungs: Clear bilaterally.

Cardiovascular
- Auscultation of Heart: Grade 3/6 systolic ejection murmur, heard at the left base.

Musculoskeletal
- Examination of the right upper extremity reveals no swelling or edema on the right radial artery. Cath site is clean, dry, and intact. No hematoma. Palpable right radial artery pulse.

RESULTS

Electrocardiogram is reviewed and revealed normal sinus rhythm with good R wave progression and evolutionary changes, which are anticipated.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

1. Coronary artery disease.
- Medical Reasoning: The patient's exam is consistent with coronary artery disease.
- Patient Education and Counseling: We discussed that he should continue to watch his diet and salt intake. We also discussed that the cardiac rehab should help with his confidence with exercising regularly and for his education.
- Medical Treatment: Continue taking aspirin 81 mg daily Continue taking Brilinta 90 mg twice a day. Continue taking Lipitor 80 mg daily. Continue taking Toprol 50 mg daily. I will refer him to cardiac rehab.

2. Newly reduced left ventricular dysfunction and moderate mitral regurgitation.
- Medical Reasoning: The patient's physical exam is consistent with this diagnosis.
- Patient Education and Counseling: We discussed that his pumping function should improve in time. We also discussed that since he is compliant with his medications and presented to the cardiac cath lab quickly, he should recover. I advised the patient that he does not need to start a diuretic at this time.
- Medical Treatment: Continue taking lisinopril 20 mg a day. Prescription for Aldactone 12.5 mg daily provided. Order for labs provided. Repeat echocardiogram ordered to be completed in 2 months.

3. Hypertension.
- Medical Reasoning: This seems stable at this time.
- Medical Treatment: Continue home blood pressure monitoring.

Chief Complaint: right ductal carcinoma in situ
Secondary Complaints: none

---------------------------------------------
MEDICAL NOTE:

CHIEF COMPLAINT

History of right ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS).

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Sophia Brown is a 75 y.o. female who presents today for a new patient evaluation due to her history of right DCIS. She is doing well but wishes to establish care today for continued monitoring.

The patient underwent a screening mammogram in 10/2019 and was found to have a calcification in the right breast. She then had a right breast ultrasound on 11/03/2019 which revealed a mass at the 2 o’clock position, 11 cm from the nipple, in the retroareolar region. The report states the mass was 0.4 by 2.0 by 3.0 centimeters. She subsequently had an ultrasound-guided core needle biopsy on 12/05/2019 and pathology results revealed grade 2 ER-positive, PR-positive DCIS. The patient then had a lumpectomy with lymphadenectomy performed on 01/20/2020. The tumor was 8 mm with negative margins and the 5 lymph nodes removed were all benign. Pathology from the tumor confirmed DCIS. Her lumpectomy was followed by adjuvant radiation therapy. Endocrine therapy was also offered but the patient declined. She has since had a mammogram in 01/2021 which was normal. The patient also reports that she performs self-breast exams regularly at home.

Mrs. Brown is a G5P5 female and estimates that her last menstrual period was approximately 30 years ago. She is not currently and has never been on hormone replacement therapy.

The patient’s last colonoscopy was done in 2018. She had a sigmoid polypectomy at that time and pathology showed a tubular adenoma.

Her cholesterol was recently noted to be elevated and the patient reports that she is exercising and reducing fatty food intake accordingly. This is being followed by her primary care provider.

PAST HISTORY

Medical
Hypercholesterolemia.
Stage 0 ER/PR-positive invasive ductal carcinoma of the right breast, status post lumpectomy and adjuvant radiation therapy.

Surgical
Right lumpectomy, lymphadenectomy x5, 01/20/2020.

SOCIAL HISTORY

Alcohol: Socially. No history of heavier consumption.
Illicit drug use: Never.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Negative for weight loss, weight gain, headaches, bone pain, urinary symptoms, blood in the stools.
Positive for back pain, joint pain, high cholesterol. Patient has sought care for these complaints. She reports that she was told the back pain and joint pain (knee) are age-related. She is being followed for the high cholesterol by her primary care provider.

PHYSICAL EXAM

The ECOG performance status today is grade 0.
Breast: There are no palpable masses; however, there is some skin thickening at the medial inferior aspect of the right breast which may be radiation skin changes.

ASSESSMENT

Stage 0 ER/PR-positive invasive ductal carcinoma of the right breast.
The patient is status post lumpectomy with removal of 5 lymph nodes which were benign. She also underwent adjuvant radiation therapy but declined endocrine therapy. Today’s clinical examination shows no evidence of recurrent disease or other malignancy. She also had a negative mammogram in 01/2021.

PLAN

1. We will continue to observe the patient.
2. She is due for a mammogram in 04/2022.
3. She should follow up with me in 1 year after the mammogram.

[doctor] hello , ms. brown .
[patient] hi . yes , that's me .
[doctor] wonderful . i'm doctor stewart . it's lovely to meet you .
[patient] you as well .
[doctor] so , you've come to see me today because you had a right breast lumpectomy last year . is that right ?
[patient] yes . on january 20th , 2020 .
[doctor] okay . and how have you been since then ? any problems or concerns ?
[patient] no , i'm feeling good . i do my self breast exams religiously now and have n't felt anything since .
[doctor] perfect . i want to back up and go over your history so i can make sure everything in your chart is correct and i do n't miss anything . so , i'll tell you what we have in your chart from your other providers and you tell me if anything is wrong or missing . sound good ?
[patient] sounds good .
[doctor] great . so , i have that you were found to have a calcification in your right breast during a mammogram in october 2019 . was that just a normal screening mammogram , or was it done because you felt a lump ?
[patient] it was just a normal one you're supposed to get every so often .
[doctor] i see . and then it looks like you had an ultrasound of your right breast on november 3rd , 2019 , which revealed a mass at the two o'clock position , 11 centimeters from the nipple in the retroareolar region . the report states the mass was point four by two by three centimeters .
[patient] yes , that sounds right . hard to remember now , though .
[doctor] yep , definitely .
[doctor] based on those results , they decided to do an ultrasound-guided core needle biopsy on december 5th , 2019 . pathology results during that biopsy came back as grade two , er positive , pr positive , dcis , or ductal carcinoma in situ .
[patient] yes . unfortunately .
[doctor] i know . scary stuff . but you had a lumpectomy on january 20th , 2020 , which removed the eight millimeter tumor and margins were negative . the pathology confirmed dcis . looks like they also removed 5 lymph nodes , which , thankfully , were negative for malignancy . that's great !
[patient] yeah , i was definitely very relieved .
[doctor] and your last mammogram was in january 2021 ? and that was normal .
[patient] yes .
[doctor] okay . so , i feel like i have a good grasp of what's been going on with you now . and you're here today to establish care with me so i can continue to follow you and make sure you're doing well , right ?
[patient] yes . fingers crossed .
[doctor] definitely . we'll keep a close eye on you and take good care of you .
[patient] okay , sounds good .
[doctor] i have a few more questions for you . when was your last colonoscopy ?
[patient] i had one in 2018 and , if i remember correctly , i had one polyp and that was removed and it was n't cancerous .
[doctor] okay , yes , i see that report now . one polyp in the sigmoid colon which had a benign tubular adenoma . okay . and when was your last menstrual period ?
[patient] gosh . it was probably around 30 years ago .
[doctor] okay . do you have children ?
[patient] i do . i have five .
[doctor] ah , big family then . that's nice .
[patient] yes . and they're all having kids of their own now , so it's getting even bigger .
[doctor] i bet . sounds like fun .
[patient] it is .
[doctor] did you have any other pregnancies that were miscarriages or terminations ?
[patient] really , i did not .
[doctor] okay . so for the record , that's g5 p5 . and now that you're post-menopausal , are you currently or have you ever been on hormone replacement therapy ?
[patient] my primary care doctor gave me the option years ago but i decided against it .
[doctor] okay . and on your review systems form , you indicated that you've not had any recent weight loss or gain , headaches , bone pain , urinary symptoms , or blood in the stools . but you did indicate that you have some back pain , joint pain , and high cholesterol . tell me some more about those .
[patient] okay . so i've seen doctors for all of those . they've said , excuse me , the back and knee pain are age-related . and the cholesterol is a fairly new diagnosis , but i am working on exercise and cutting back on fatty foods to see if i can get it lower without any medication .
[doctor] okay . and your primary care doctor is following you for that , right ?
[patient] that's correct .
[doctor] okay . for medications , i have that you take coq10 , vitamin d , vitamin c , fish oil , and elderberry fruit . is that all right ?
[patient] yes , and that's all .
[doctor] okay . so for your medical history , it's high cholesterol and stage 0 er/pr positive invasive ductal carcinoma of the right breast . any surgeries other than the lumpectomy ?
[patient] i did have my tubes tied after my last baby , but that's all .
[doctor] okay . and how about family history ?
[patient] my mom had non-hodgkin's lymphoma and my dad had prostate cancer and heart disease , but i think that's it .
[doctor] all right . any family history of breast cancer ?
[patient] none .
[doctor] did any of your children have medical issues or siblings with medical problems ?
[patient] i do not have any siblings and , thankfully , my children are all healthy .
[doctor] wonderful . do you have any history of smoking , illicit drug use , heavy alcohol consumption ?
[patient] no drugs . i do drink socially , but never more than that . and i used to smoke , but really , everybody did back then and i probably quit about 30 years ago .
[doctor] excellent . i have that you're allergic to penicillin . any other allergies ?
[patient] nope , just penicillin .
[doctor] okay . i think that covers it . hop up here and let me take a look at you .
[doctor] okay , so let's use the normal new patient exam template . only change to make is the breast exam . there are no palpable masses , however , there is skin thickening at the medial inferior aspect of the right breast which may be radiation skin changes .
[doctor] in the result section , note that her ecog performance status today is zero .
[doctor] do you have ... did you have radiation after the lumpectomy ?
[patient] i did . we also talked about endocrine therapy , but i decided against that .
[doctor] okay . so your exam looks good , no masses , just some skin changes from that radiation . now , let's go over the plan for you .
[patient] okay , sounds good .
[doctor] as you know , you've had dcis which we'll list in my note as stage zero , er/pr positive , invasive ductal carcinoma of the right breast . your status post-lumpectomy with removal of five lymph nodes that were benign . you also had , um , radiation therapy but declined endocrine therapy . today's clinical examination shows no evidence of recurrence with the dcis or other malignancy and your mammogram in january , 2021 was also negative for recurrence and malignancy .
[doctor] so , based on all of that , we can just continue to observe you .
[patient] okay . that sounds great . and when do i come back in to see you ?
[doctor] in a year , but you should have another mammogram in april of 2022 before you come back to see me .

MEDICAL NOTE:

CHIEF COMPLAINT

Right elbow pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Lawrence Butler is a pleasant 45-year-old male who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of right elbow pain.

Over the past week, the patient has developed 6/10 pain in the ""inside"" of his right elbow. The pain may radiate into his forearm on occasion, but does not extend up to his shoulder. He denies any history of trauma or injury, but he did start making pottery during the COVID-19 pandemic and suspects that his symptoms could be related to that. His symptoms affect his ability to lift objects or perform his typical activities of daily living. Ibuprofen provides minimal symptomatic relief.

SOCIAL HISTORY

The patient reports that he began making pottery during the COVID-19 pandemic.

MEDICATIONS

The patient reports that he has been taking ibuprofen.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Musculoskeletal: Reports right elbow pain.

VITALS

Normal

PHYSICAL EXAM

MSK: Examination of the right elbow: Moderate tenderness at the medial epicondyle. No pain with supination of the forearm. Pain with pronation of the forearm. Pain with resistance against flexion of the wrist.

RESULTS

X-ray imaging of the right elbow was obtained and reviewed in office today. These reveal no evidence of fracture or bony abnormality.

ASSESSMENT

Right medial epicondylitis.

PLAN

The patient and I discussed his diagnosis in detail, and I explained that his symptoms are likely caused by overuse and potential damage of the tendons. We will provide him with sling to be worn during the day while he is awake. I want him to take ibuprofen 600 mg every 6 hours with food for a full week and ice the elbow for 20 minutes, 3 times daily. Finally, I advised the patient to rest his elbow and avoid doing any pottery for the next couple of weeks.

INSTRUCTIONS

The patient will follow up in 1 week.

---------------------------------------------","[doctor] hey lawrence how're you doing
[patient] i'm doing alright aside from this elbow pain
[doctor] so it looks like here that you came in to see us today for an evaluation of that right elbow pain can you tell me can you can you tell me well first of all what do you think has been causing that pain
[patient] so i really during this pandemic i really got into ceramics and doing pottery so i've been doing a lot of pottery and over the past week i then started to develop this elbow pain
[doctor] okay and then so tell me a little bit more about that elbow pain where does it hurt exactly
[patient] you know it hurts a lot in the inside of my elbow
[doctor] okay so the inside of your right elbow okay
[patient] yeah
[doctor] and then does the pain radiate down your arm or up into your shoulder or anything like that
[patient] it does n't go into my shoulder it's it stays mostly at my elbow but it can go down a bit into my forearm
[doctor] okay and then do you remember any trauma did you hit your arm or elbow or any on anything
[patient] no nothing i i really was trying to think if there is anything else and i ca n't think of anything
[doctor] okay and you've never injured that right elbow before
[patient] no
[doctor] alright so now let's talk a little bit about your pain and how bad it how bad is that pain on a scale from zero to ten ten being the worst pain you've ever felt in your life
[patient] i would say probably a six
[doctor] okay and does that pain keep you up at night
[patient] it does
[doctor] okay and when you have that kind of pain does it keep you from doing other type of activities
[patient] yeah i mean i still try to like work through with using my arm but yeah it's it's it's difficult for me sometimes to lift and do things because of that pain
[doctor] okay and then and how long has this pain been going on
[patient] about four days now
[doctor] alright and anything you've done to help relieve or alleviate that pain any anything that that's giving you relief
[patient] i've tried ibuprofen that helps a little but not much
[doctor] okay so if it's okay with you i would like to do a a quick physical exam your vitals look good and i'm gon na do a focused exam on that right elbow i'm gon na go ahead and and and press here do you do you have any pain when i press here
[patient] yes i do
[doctor] okay so you are positive for pain to palpation you do note that moderate tenderness of the medial epicondyle now i'm gon na have you turn your wrist as if you're turning a door knob do you have any pain when you do that
[patient] not really
[doctor] okay now turn your wrist in so do you have any pain when you do that
[patient] yeah that hurts
[doctor] okay so you do have pain you were positive for pain when you pronate that that that forearm okay i'm gon na go ahead and have you rest your arm on the table here palm side up now i want you to raise your hand by bending at the wrist and i'm gon na put some resistance against it do you have any pain when i press against your flexed wrist
[patient] yes i do
[doctor] alright so you are positive for pain with resistance against flexion of that left wrist so i let let's go ahead and review the x-ray that we did of your elbow the good news is i do n't see any fracture or bony abnormality of that right elbow which is good so let's talk a little bit about my assessment and plan for you so for the problem with elbow pain i do believe that this is consistent with medial epicondylitis which is caused by the overuse and potential damage of those tendons that bend
[doctor] that that bend the wrist towards the palm now i want you to rest it i'm gon na order a sling and i want you to wear the sling while you're awake now we're also gon na have you apply ice to the elbow for twenty minutes three times a day and i want you to take ibuprofen that's gon na be six hundred milligrams q.6 h. with food and i want you to take that for a full week now you're not gon na like this part but i want you to hold off for the next couple of weeks on doing any type of pottery work okay alright now what i wan na do is i wan na see you again in a week and i wan na see how you're doing okay

[patient] and i've been in a lot of pain it started about i would say probably about three days ago
[doctor] okay
[patient] started having pain on my left back
[doctor] okay
[patient] and since then i continued to have pain it is traveling a little lower it's gotten little low but i definitely have not passed it yet and i'm just in so much pain
[doctor] okay so is the pain that you're having is it constant or does it come and go
[patient] it's constant
[doctor] okay
[patient] all the time i ca n't get comfortable
[doctor] alright are you able to urinate
[patient] i am and this morning i actually started seeing some blood
[doctor] okay yeah so and i know you said i see you've had some kidney stones in the past like how many times would you say you've had one of these episodes
[patient] i've had it for probably this might be my third time
[doctor] third time alright
[patient] yeah i have n't had one in a while but yeah this is my third time
[doctor] okay so have you noticed any nausea chills fever
[patient] no fever some chills and i i just in so much pain i i ca n't eat and i do feel a little nauseous
[doctor] okay that sound definitely understandable so you've been in a lot of pain so have you tried to take any medications to alleviate the pain
[patient] yeah i've been taking tylenol i have had to try some ibuprofen i know you said to be careful with my blood pressure but i have been trying to do that because i'm just in so much pain and it's not really working
[doctor] okay and before what would you how long would you say it took you to pass the other stones or how was that that resolved
[patient] yeah usually usually about about three four days to pass it yeah
[doctor] right so this is this is the looks like this is the third day
[patient] yeah
[doctor] so we are getting close there
[patient] okay
[doctor] yeah so hopefully we can pass it but we'll i'll definitely we can take a look at it here in a second so while you are here i also wanted to check up on your your diabetes and and hypertension you have so i'm looking here at my notes and you're on two . five of norvasc for your high blood pressure when you came in today your blood pressure was a was a little bit high and i know that's probably because you are in a bunch of pain so that definitely makes sense but i think last time we talked a little bit about you getting a blood pressure cuff and taking your blood pressures regularly so those readings first off were you able to get the blood pressure cuff
[patient] i was i have n't been great about taking it but i did get the blood pressure cuff
[doctor] so the time that you did take it and i think that's something we got to work on is you've taken them i think at least three times a week i would like you to what have those been running
[patient] like the top numbers they're usually the one thirties sometimes i get i do go into one forties and once it went to like one fifty
[doctor] okay
[patient] and then the bottom number has been between seventy and eighty okay that i mean that's not too bad i think when you were first diagnosed you were up there in the
[doctor] the one eighties which was really high
[patient] right
[doctor] so let me talk a little bit also about you trying to lower your salt intake to like like twenty three hundred milligrams a a day so have you been able to do that
[patient] trying my best but doc i really like my french fries
[doctor] yeah
[patient] like
[doctor] we we all like we all like the french fries you know but you know we we we we also do n't like strokes so we do n't want to have a scope and all the all the french fries so that's something definitely i would like you to work on and do you think you'd be able to to curb that french fry habit or that bad this bad food habits by yourself or do you think you need help
[patient] yeah some help could be helpful okay yeah we can definitely get you connected with someone just to help you with your diet kinda that's the biggest thing for a lot of my patient is trying to control that diet alright
[doctor] so i also want to take a look here at your diabetes and last time you came in your a1c was a little bit higher at seven . three and you're on five hundred of metformin currently so have you been taking your blood sugars before you eat everyday
[patient] i have and those those have been pretty good they are like in the low one hundreds
[doctor] okay that that that's definitely good because when you came in i think we did a glucose test on you couple of months ago and you were around three hundred which is which is pretty up there so i'm glad that you know those levels are down and have you been taking that metformin everyday
[patient] i do
[doctor] okay
[patient] i do take it
[doctor] that that that that's really good alright so let me do a quick physical exam on you just a couple of questions before i take a look at your your abdomen and and your back talked to take a look at that that kidney stones you're having so i just want to make sure are you having any any chest pain
[patient] no chest pain
[doctor] no chest pain are you having any belly pain
[patient] the back pain is starting to kind of go down into my groin but i would n't say any back pain i mean abdominal pain
[doctor] no abdominal pain alright so let me check here i'm gon na listen to your heart real quick and so on your heart exam i do hear a grade two out of six systolic ejection murmur and that we knew about that already so not really worried about that currently listen to your lungs your lungs are clear bilaterally i do n't hear any crackles or wheezes so let me press here on your abdomen does that hurt
[patient] yes
[doctor] okay i'm gon na press here on your back is that painful
[patient] yes
[doctor] alright so on your examination of your abdomen there is tenderness to palpation of the abdomen there is n't any rebound or guarding though and only there is also cva tinnitus on the right on your on your flank as well and so it seems to me you know that you do have that kidney stone looks like you do have some inflammation around your kidney that's what that that's that tenderness around your cva is is telling me so let's go talk a little bit about my assessment and plan for you so you know right now because of your history of of having kidney stones you you do have a kidney stone so what we're gon na do is first off i'm gon na get you some pain medication kinda you're in a ton of pain right now i'm gon na prescribe you some oxycodone five milligrams you can take that every six to eight hours as needed for pain and so hopefully that can help you feeling better and you can continue to take that tylenol for any breakthrough pain that you're having i do wan na make sure that you're pushing fluids right now because we need to try to push that stone out that you're having just kinda clear your kidneys and that that would definitely help i also want to give you a strainer so you can strain your urine to see if you do actually pass that stone and then i'm going to refer you to urology and we're actually i'm gon na have you you even if you pass a stone in the next couple of days i want you to go anyway because it seems like you're having recurrent kidney stones and so hopefully they can help do something to to help this from happening in the future for your hypertension i'm gon na keep you on that two . five norvasc your your blood pressures look good so i'm not gon na make any changes there and then for your diabetes we'll keep you on the five hundred of metformin and i also want to give you a referral to nutrition to a dietitian and they will be able to help you with your your diet i know you said you have a few issues so you know they can possibly write a diet for you and if you follow it you know hopefully in the future we can get you off of both of these medications and get you back to normal so how does that all sound
[patient] that sounds good and i i just i just want this pain to go away so thank you

MEDICAL NOTE:

CHIEF COMPLAINT

Iron deficiency anemia.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Mrs. Christina Cooper is a 65-year-old female who presents with a long-history of iron deficiency anemia.

The patient reports she has been living with anemia since she was 13 years old. She attempted to donate blood on 12/2019 but was unable to due to her anemia. She has a history of heavy menstruation and a hysterectomy in 1996. She completed a colonoscopy 5-6 years ago with nonsignificant findings. She denies having a pacemaker, defibrillator, sleep apnea, or using oxygen.

Mrs. Cooper reports a myriad of symptoms, stating she feels fatigued often during the day, feverish with chills at times, and during activity feels she cannot catch her breath and some wheezing is present. She has been having some headaches which is uncommon for her. Additionally, she is noticing tingling sensations, cold sensitivity, and her anxiety and depression have worsened.

PAST HISTORY

Surgical
Hysterectomy, 1996.

Procedures
Colonoscopy 5-6 years ago.

SOCIAL HISTORY

Drink’s alcohol 1-2 times per year.

CURRENT MEDICATIONS

Ferrous Sulfate 25 mg tablet twice per day (1 in the morning, 1 in the evening), Vitamin B12 OTC.

PHYSICAL EXAM

Gastrointestinal
Abdomen non-tender.

ASSESSMENT

• Iron deficiency anemia

Mrs. Cooper is a 65-year-old female who was diagnosed with iron deficiency anemia in 12/2019 and was unable to donate blood. Her follow-up blood work in 01/2020 revealed a low hemoglobin, stable hematocrit, and normal iron labs, although, ferritin was low. She has been taking ferrous sulfate 325 mg by mouth.

PLAN

I have asked her to continue each ferrous sulfate dose with vitamin C found in orange juice for the next 12 weeks then recheck CBC, iron ferritin, B-12, and folate. A referral was sent for her to see a hematologist. We will plan for EGD and colonoscopy to assess for potential sources of anemia or GI bleed. If this is inconclusive, capsule endoscopy can be considered.

INSTRUCTIONS

Schedule upper endoscopy, colonoscopy and appointment with hematologist. Return to the clinic if symptoms worsen.

---------------------------------------------","[doctor] today i'm seeing christina cooper . her date of birth is 07/01/1954 . uh , ms. cooper is a new patient who was referred by diane nelson for a long-standing iron deficiency anemia .
[doctor] hello , how are you ?
[patient] i'm good , thank you .
[doctor] so tell me what brings you in today .
[patient] recently i tried to donate blood , around december i think , and they told me i was anemic , which is something i've been dealing with for a while , so it's not the first time i've been told i'm anemic .
[doctor] or how have you been feeling in general with this ?
[patient] not great . i have been feeling fatigued often during the day , and even feverish with chills at times . when i try to be active i like i ca n't catch my breath and i feel like i'm wheezing . i've had some headaches too , which is not like me .
[doctor] okay . are there any other symptoms ?
[patient] i've been noting some chilling sensations . i also get cold so easily . it's annoying . i feel like i have to really bundle up . i do n't know if this is related but my anxiety and depression feel like it has been getting worse lately . i feel like a mess .
[doctor] sounds like you're not feeling great , obviously . and i'm glad you came to see us . um , we're certainly going to try to figure this out and figure out what's going on , uh , but it sounds like you've been dealing with this anemia for a long time ?
[patient] yeah , i've been anemic since i was 13 years old .
[doctor] right . so why do your doctors think you're anemic ? do you have a history of heavy periods ?
[patient] well i did have heavy periods until i had a hysterectomy in 1996 . but no , they have not told me why they think i'm anemic , which is frustrating honestly .
[doctor] yeah . i can imagine that is . um , let's see if we can help though . since you had your hysterectomy your periods , of course , are no longer the issue . um , when was your last colonoscopy ?
[patient] about five to six years ago .
[doctor] and was it relatively a normal exam ? did you have any polyps ?
[patient] no . they said they'd see me in 10 years .
[doctor] well that's good news .
[patient] yeah , i agree .
[doctor] um , do you have a pacemaker or defibrillator , or have sleep apnea , or use oxygen at night ?
[patient] no .
[doctor] all right . do you ever drink alcohol ?
[patient] yeah , but only once or twice a year .
[doctor] okay . are you taking any supplements such as iron or vitamin b12 ?
[patient] i already started taking my iron pills which i have not taken in about a year .
[doctor] all right . and what are you taking ?
[patient] i'm taking 25 milligram tablets , twice daily .
[doctor] okay , and that's the , the ferrous sulfate ?
[patient] yeah , that's it . i take one in the morning and one in the evening .
[doctor] okay . anything else ?
[patient] yeah , i take vitamin b12 , just the over the counter stuff .
[doctor] okay , very good . all right , well let's go ahead and take a look and see what's going on .
[patient] sounds good . thank you .
[doctor] of course . you'll hear me , uh , talk through your exam so that i get all the information documented .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] all right . so use my general physical exam template . i will start by listening to your heart and lungs .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] all right . next , i'd like you to lay back so i can examine your abdomen .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] is there any tenderness where i'm pressing ?
[patient] no .
[doctor] okay . you can sit up . so your physical exam is normal without any significant findings . all right ms. cooper , often when we initially see anemia and your host of symptoms , we suspect internal bleeding .
[patient] is that why they want me to have another upper endoscopy ?
[doctor] actually it would be an upper endoscopy and a colonoscopy , but yes , likely that's the reason why .
[patient] lovely .
[doctor] yeah . unfortunately our cameras do not meet all the way in the middle , so if those tests back , come , if those tests come back fine , then we'll have you swallow a pill camera to take pictures as it moves through your , uh , system .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] we may not need to , but it's just the first thing we can do to make sure that you're not losing blood . um , the second thing we can do is have you see a hematologist . they will tell us if you need to give any , to give you any intravenous iron , or maybe something to help your body store the iron better .
[patient] all right .
[doctor] so let's go ahead , get your upper endoscopy and colonoscopy scheduled .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] um , have you ever had any issue with sedation in the past ?
[patient] no , i was just sleepy afterwards .
[doctor] okay . well we will give you a bowel prep to clean out your bowels ahead of time . um , if we do these tests and they are normal , like i said , then we will consider that capsule endoscopy .
[patient] okay . sounds like a plan .
[doctor] all right . so after that you'll be all done and we will send you to the hematologist . additionally , i'm going to need you to start taking your iron pills with orange juice . uh , the vitamin c will help you absorb the iron better . do this for about 8-12 weeks , uh , and then we can reassess your blood work .
[patient] okay , that sounds great .
[doctor] all right . well i think we have our plan . on your way out , stop by and schedule your upper endoscopy and c- colonoscopy . uh , we will send a referral to dr. flores who is is the hematologist , so schedule that appointment . um , here are your instructions for the pre- uh , the bowel prep . uh , call us if you have any questions or worsening symptoms . we'll be happy to help you .
[patient] thank you .
[doctor] you're welcome . have a great day , have a great day ms. cooper .
[patient] you too .
[doctor] all right . this is christina cooper , pleasant 65 year old female who was diagnosed with iron deficiency anemia in 12-2019 , and w- and was unable to donate blood . um , her followup blood work on 01/20/20 was revealed a low hemoglobin , stable hematocrit and normal iron labs , although ferritin was low . um , she was taking ferrous sulfate , three hundred , twenty phil- 25 milligrams by mouth . i've asked her to continue each dose with vitamin c found in orange juice , for the next 12 weeks , then recheck to the cbc , iron , ferritin , b12 , and folate . um , a referral was sent to her hematologist . we will plan for an egd and a colonoscopy to assess for potential sources of anemia or gi bleed . if this is inconclusive , capsule endoscopy will be considered . thanks .",2609.5,"Ferrous Sulfate 25 mg tablet twice per day (1 in the morning, 1 in the evening), Vitamin B12 OTC.",opus_result,"Based on the transcript, the patient is currently taking:

MEDICAL NOTE:

CHIEF COMPLAINT

Tick bite.

MEDICAL HISTORY

Patient reports a history of arthritis, hypertension, and diabetes type 2.

SOCIAL HISTORY

Patient reports he enjoys spending time outside in the woods and working in the yard. He went hunting with his grandchildren a couple of weeks ago.

MEDICATIONS

Patient reports taking lisinopril 20 mg once a day and metformin 1000 mg twice daily most of the time.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Constitutional: Reports general ill feelings. Denies any fever, chills, flu like symptoms, body aches, or trouble waking.
Respiratory: Denies cough or shortness of breath.
Musculoskeletal: Denies joint pain or problems with ambulation.
Skin: Reports warmth on the right knee.
Neurological: Reports headache. Denies dizziness.

VITALS

Blood Pressure: 122/70 mmHg.
Heart Rate: 67 beats per minute.
Body Temperature: 98.4 degrees F.

PHYSICAL EXAM

Neck
- General Examination: Neck is supple without thyromegaly or lymphadenopathy.

Respiratory
- Auscultation of Lungs: Clear bilaterally.

Cardiovascular
- Auscultation of Heart: Regular rate and rhythm. No murmurs, gallops or rubs.

Musculoskeletal
- Examination of the right knee: Erythema and edema as well as an area of fluctuance noted over the right patella. There is pain to palpation of the right anterior knee. Full range of motion.

Integumentary
- Examination: There is evidence of a bull’s eye rash over the right knee.

RESULTS

Patient's previous kidney function is within normal limits.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

1. Tick bite.
- Medical Reasoning: My concern is that he might have Lyme disease based on the presentation of his right knee.
- Patient Education and Counseling: The patient and I discussed blood testing to determine if he does in fact have Lyme disease. I explained that Lyme disease can cause problems with other organs if not treated appropriately. We discussed that sometimes antibiotics need to be administered intravenously if oral antibiotics are not given early enough. We will see how he does with a course of oral antibiotics as I would like to avoid intravenous antibiotics.
- Medical Treatment: Prescription for doxycycline 100 mg twice a day for 3 weeks provided. Lyme titer and Western blot will be obtained to determine if he has Lyme disease.

2. Hypertension.
- Medical Reasoning: This is well-controlled at this time.
- Patient Education and Counseling: The patient and I discussed that he is doing really well monitoring his blood pressure at home.
- Medical Treatment: Continue lisinopril 20 mg once a day. Lipid panel ordered to assess his cholesterol levels.

3. Diabetes type 2.
- Medical Reasoning: He is doing a good job managing his diabetes since his blood sugars are running in the 120s. I do not think we need to make any adjustments, but we will see what the hemoglobin A1c shows as that gives us an idea of what his blood sugars are doing on a long-term basis.
- Patient Education and Counseling: We discussed that metformin can affect kidney function; however, his kidney function was last checked 2 months ago, and it has remained within normal limits.
- Medical Treatment: Continue metformin 1000 mg twice a day. Hemoglobin A1c ordered. Basic metabolic panel ordered to assess kidney function.

[doctor] okay
[patient] less
[doctor] i like it too alright are you taking the metformin twice a day
[patient] not everyday but most of the time
[doctor] okay alright and are you checking your blood sugars pretty regularly
[patient] i try to
[doctor] okay and do you do you know on average how they're running are they running below like one fifty or
[patient] yeah it's definitely running below that
[doctor] okay your blood sugars are running below
[patient] it's it's probably with with with the metformin it seems to be you know one twenty
[doctor] good
[patient] pretty regular
[doctor] good your blood sugars are running in the one twenties that's really good okay alright well i wan na just go ahead and do a quick physical exam okay so i'm looking here at your vital signs and your vital signs look really good i do think you're doing a good job with taking your lisinopril your blood pressure's about one twenty two over seventy right now which is right where we want it your heart rate is nice and slow at sixty seven again which is right where we want it and i do n't appreciate any fever today you you have a normal temperature at ninety eight . four which is really good so i'm just gon na be going ahead and calling out some physical exam findings and i'm gon na let you know what that means when i'm done okay so on your heart exam your heart is in a nice regular rate and rhythm i do n't appreciate any murmur rub or gallop on your lung exam your lungs are nice and clear to auscultation bilaterally on your right knee exam i do appreciate some erythema and edema as well as an area of fluctuance over your right patella now does it hurt when i press
[patient] it's a little bit sore
[doctor] okay there is pain to palpation of the right anterior knee and i'm just gon na bend your knee up and down does that hurt at all
[patient] no no it's just more of the typical grinding that i would feel
[doctor] okay there is full range of motion of the right knee and on skin examination there is evidence of a bull's-eye rash over the right knee okay so what does that mean richard so that means that you know you do have some area of some inflammation over the over the right knee where you where you have that tick bite and you do have what we call that bull's eye rash which is what we get concerned about with with lyme disease so let's just talk a little bit about you know my assessment and my plan for you okay so for this first problem of your of your tick bite my concern is that you might have lyme disease based on the presentation of your right knee so i'm gon na go ahead and start you on doxycycline one hundred milligrams twice a day
[patient] we're gon na continue that for about three weeks i'm also gon na go ahead and send a lyme titer as well as a western blot to see if you do in fact have lyme lyme disease and we'll have to go ahead and just see how you do with this we you know i'd like to avoid intravenous antibiotics which i think we can avoid but i wanted to see how you do so
[doctor] do you have any questions about that
[patient] yeah i did n't know what those last two things or just
[doctor] yeah so so we are gon na start you on some antibiotics to help help you with this
[patient] you know possible lyme disease and i'm gon na just order some blood tests just to see exactly what's going on and then you know sometimes people need intravenous antibiotics because lyme disease can cause problems on other organs like your heart that type of thing
[doctor] if not treated appropriately and sometimes we need to give antibiotics through the iv which i'd like to avoid i think that we got this early enough that we can just treat you with some oral antibiotics okay for your second problem of your hypertension you know i think you're doing a really good job let's go ahead and continue you on the lisinopril twenty milligrams once a day and i wan na just go ahead and order a lipid panel just to make sure that everything is okay with your cholesterol how does that sound
[patient] that's fine
[doctor] great and then for your third problem of your diabetes i wan na just go ahead and order a hemoglobin a1c and continue you on the metformin one thousand milligrams twice a day it sounds like you're doing a good job since your blood sugars are running in the one twenties i do n't think we need to make any adjustments but we'll see what the hemoglobin a1c shows that gives us a an idea of what your blood sugars are doing on a long-term basis how does that sound
[patient] okay at what point time do you start kinda checking kidney function i've been told that metformin can possibly cause some kidney issues
[doctor] so it can you know your kidney function we've you know i think you've been really lucky it's been normal i checked it about two months ago and it looks pretty good it looks pretty normal but since we're doing blood work on you i can go ahead and order a a basic metabolic panel just to make sure that your kidney function is stable
[patient] okay that'd be good
[doctor] okay anything else
[patient] not that i can think of at this time as soon as i leave
[doctor] well you know where to find me okay
[patient] alright
[doctor] take care bye",3684.3333333333335,Patient reports taking lisinopril 20 mg once a day and metformin 1000 mg twice daily most of the time.,opus_result,"Based on the transcript, the patient is currently taking:

MEDICAL NOTE:

CHIEF COMPLAINT

Right-sided abdominal pain

MEDICAL HISTORY

Patient reports history of kidney stones.

FAMILY HISTORY

Patient reports his father has a history of kidney stones.

MEDICATIONS

Patient reports use of Tylenol.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Gastrointestinal: Reports right-sided abdominal pain and nausea. Denies vomiting
Genitourinary: Reports dysuria and dark colored urine. Denies hematuria.

PHYSICAL EXAM

Gastrointestinal
- Examination of Abdomen: No masses or tenderness to palpation. No rebound or guarding. No peritoneal signs. Positive CVA tenderness on the right flank.

RESULTS

Previous CT scan of the abdomen ordered by the patient's PCP is reviewed and demonstrates a 0.5 cm kidney stone located in the proximal right ureter. There is no evidence of hydronephrosis.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

1. Acute nephrolithiasis.
- Medical Reasoning: The patient presents with complaints of right-sided abdominal pain. His previous CT scan was reviewed and demonstrates a 0.5 cm kidney stone located in the proximal right ureter without evidence of hydronephrosis.
- Medical Treatment: I have recommended that he push fluids in order to help facilitate urination to help pass the stone. He will be provided with a strainer to allow us to potentially test the stone if he is able to pass it. I have also prescribed oxycodone 5 mg every 6 to 8 hours as needed for pain. He can continue to alternate oxycodone with Tylenol. A basic metabolic panel, urinalysis, and urine culture will also be ordered.

INSTRUCTIONS

He will follow up in 1 to 2 weeks. If he is still having symptoms at that time, we will discuss further treatment such as lithotripsy or ureteroscopy. He is to contact me if he is having worsening symptoms over the next week.

[patient] well i've been having this sharp pain on the right side of my abdomen below my ribs for the last several days
[doctor] i saw my doctor and they ordered a cat scan and said i had a kidney stone and sent me to see a urologist okay well does the pain move or or or go anywhere or does it stay right in that same spot yeah it feels like it goes to my lower abdomen in into my groin okay and is the pain constant or does it come and go it comes and goes when it comes it's it's pretty it's pretty bad i feel like i ca n't find a comfortable position okay and do you notice any any pain when you urinate or when you pee

[patient] okay
[doctor] okay so on physical examination of the abdomen on a abdominal exam there is no tenderness to palpation there is no evidence of any rebound or guarding there is no peritoneal signs there is positive cva tenderness on the right flank so essentially what that means russell is that you know you have some tenderness over your over your right kidney and that just means that you might have some inflammation there so i i reviewed the results of the ct scan of your abdomen that the primary care doctor ordered and it does show a . five centimeter kidney stone located in the proximal right ureter so this the ureter is the duct in which urine passes between the kidney and the bladder there's no evidence of what we call hydronephrosis this means you know swelling of the kidney which is good means that things are still able to get through so let's talk a little bit about my assessment and my plan okay so for your first problem of this acute nephrolithiasis or kidney stone i i wan na go ahead and recommend that you push fluids to help facilitate urination and peeing to help pass the stone i'm going to prescribe oxycodone five milligrams every six to eight hours as needed for pain you can continue to alternate that with some tylenol i'm going to give you a strainer that you can use to strain your urine so that we can see it see the stone when it passes and we can send it for some some tests if that happens i'm also gon na order what we call a basic metabolic panel a urinalysis and a urine culture now i wan na see you again in one to two weeks and if you're still having symptoms we'll have to discuss further treatment such as lithotripsy which is essentially a shock wave procedure in which we sedate you and use shock waves to break up the stone to help it pass we could also do what we call a ureteroscopy which is a small telescope small camera used to go up to to the urethra and bladder and up into the ureter to retrieve the stone so let's see how you do over the next week and i want you to contact me if you're having worsening symptoms okay okay sounds good thank you",911.0,Patient reports use of Tylenol.,opus_result,"Based on the transcript, the patient mentioned taking Tylenol for the pain, but it hasn't really helped.

Age: 34.0
Gender: female
Chief Complaint: Left knee pain
Secondary Complaints: hypertension;type 2 diabetes

---------------------------------------------
MEDICAL NOTE:

CHIEF COMPLAINT

Left knee pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Andrea Barnes is a 34-year-old female who presents today for evaluation of left knee pain.

The patient has been experiencing intermittent episodes of pain and sudden instability with ambulation. Her pain is localized deep in her patella and occurs less than once daily. Due to the fleeting nature of these episodes, she has not taken medication and simply braces herself until it passes. She denies any trauma or injury, or ever hearing or feeling a pop in the knee. Her symptoms do not interfere with her daily activities and she does not use a cane.

Regarding her hypertension, it has been several days since she last checked her blood pressure at home, but it was approximately 120/70 mmHg at that time. Her current medications include amlodipine, lisinopril, and hydrochlorothiazide, all of which she takes on a regular basis.

In terms of her diabetes, her fasting morning blood glucose levels have been approximately 130 based on home monitoring. This is slightly higher than usual, even though she has been compliant with metformin and Farxiga. She does try to avoid eating late at night.

MEDICAL HISTORY

Patient reports a personal history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes.

SOCIAL HISTORY

Patient likes to travel and is planning a trip to Columbus, Georgia in the next month or so. She is part of the Lion's Club.

MEDICATIONS

Patient reports that she is taking amlodipine, lisinopril 20 mg once daily, hydrochlorothiazide, Metformin, and Farxiga.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Musculoskeletal: Reports left knee pain and instability,

VITALS

Temperature: 98.2 degrees F
Heart rate: 72 bpm
Respirations: 16
Blood pressure: 122/70 mmHg

PHYSICAL EXAM

MSK: Examination of the right knee: No ecchymosis or edema. No effusion. No pain with palpation.
Examination of the left knee: Full range of motion. Negative varus and valgus stress test.

RESULTS

X-rays were obtained and reviewed today. These reveal no evidence of fracture or bony abnormality.

ASSESSMENT

1. Left knee pain.
2. Hypertension.
3. Diabetes mellitus type 2.

PLAN

After reviewing the patients x-rays, I believe there is some arthritis in the knee. I'm going to prescribe meloxicam 15 mg once daily. We can consider physical therapy to strengthen the muscles around the area to prevent any further issues.

Her hypertension is well controlled with her current medication regimen. She can continue with lisinopril 20 mg once daily. I'm also going to order an echocardiogram for further evaluation of the murmur heard on exam.

She has been compliant with metformin as prescribed, but her blood glucose levels have been slightly elevated recently. I'm going to order a lipid panel, as well as a hemoglobin A1c to determine if any adjustments need to be made to her dose of metformin.

---------------------------------------------","[doctor] okay hi andrea well i
[patient] hello
[doctor] i understand you're you've come in with some right knee pain can you tell me about it what's going on

[patient] so i had a piece of cake before i came in here is that gon na affect the the lab work
[doctor] yeah we'll probably do a fasting blood sugar we'll we'll order the hemoglobin a1c that should n't be actually matter because that checks long term but if we need your blood sugar may be elevated today i i would n't be surprised alright and i forgot to examine your back by the way so on your back exam you do have some tenderness in the paraspinal areas of your back in the in the lower back mostly no midline tenderness you have good reflexes so i think this is all muscular pain right now for your back pain i'm gon na go ahead and put you on some naprosyn and some flexeril which is a muscle relaxer i'm gon na give you some exercises you can do to help you get off the couch it'll also help your blood sugar and why do n't we have you if that does n't work the the pain medicine and the physical we can start physical therapy and see if that helps okay

MEDICAL NOTE:

CHIEF COMPLAINT

Left foot pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Jean Martinez is a pleasant 27-year-old female who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of left foot pain.

The patient sustained an injury to her left foot while playing soccer yesterday. She became entangled with another player, causing the player to fall onto the patient's foot, resulting in immediate pain. After the incident, she required help to get off of the field and was unable to participate for the rest of the game. Her trainer wrapped her foot, and she has tried ice, elevation, and ibuprofen to treat her symptoms. with medication, she rates her pain as 3/10, but without medication her pain is rated as 7-8/10. There is no numbness, tingling, or other abnormal sensations associated with her pain.

Of note, the patient has sustained several injuries in the past while playing soccer, but this is her first left foot injury.

MEDICAL HISTORY

The patient reports that she has sustained several soccer injuries in the past.

SOCIAL HISTORY

The patient has been playing soccer since she was 4 or 5 years old. She is currently playing in a local league.

MEDICATIONS

The patient reports that she has been taking ibuprofen.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Musculoskeletal: Reports left foot pain.
Neurological: Denies left foot numbness or tingling.

VITALS

Blood pressure: 118/72 mmHg
Heart rate: 58 bpm
Respiratory rate: 14
Temperature: Afebrile
Oxygen saturation: 99% on room air

PHYSICAL EXAM

CV: Regular rate and rhythm without clicks, rubs, or murmurs. No ectopic beats noted on auscultation of the heart. Brisk capillary refill, less than 3 seconds. Dorsalis pedis pulse is intact and strong.
RESPIRATORY: Lungs are clear and equal bilaterally.
NEURO: Motor and sensation in the left foot are intact to light touch.
MSK: Examination of the left foot: Ecchymosis on the plantar and dorsal aspects of the foot. Associated swelling. Tenderness to palpation of the midfoot. Positive piano key test.

RESULTS

X-ray images of the left foot were obtained and reviewed today. These reveal subtle dorsal displacement of the base of the 2nd metatarsal with a 3 mm separation of the 1st and 2nd metatarsal bases. There is presence of a bony fragment in the Lisfranc joint space.

ASSESSMENT

Lisfranc fracture, left foot.

PLAN

I explained the nature of her injury in detail. Based on her exam and x-ray findings, she will most likely require surgery of the left foot, but I want to order an MRI to assess for any ligamentous injuries. We discussed the procedure and postoperative expectations, such as recovery time and restrictions, at length. We also discussed the complications associated with deferring surgical intervention including poor bone and ligament healing, pes planus deformation, and a high likelihood of developing arthritis in the foot. She will be unable to participate for the remainder of the soccer season, but should be able to play next season.

INSTRUCTIONS

We will see the patient on Monday, for surgery.

---------------------------------------------","[doctor] hey jean how're you doing today
[patient] i'm doing alright aside from this foot pain that i have
[doctor] so i see here that you looks like you hurt your left foot here where you were playing soccer can you tell me a little bit more about what happened
[patient] yeah so yeah i was playing in a soccer game yesterday and i was trying to steal the ball from another player and she ended up falling directly onto my right foot and i do n't know i i mean i was trying to get around her and my body ended up twisting around her and then i accidentally felt a pain in my foot
[doctor] okay so have you ever hurt your left foot before
[patient] no i've had a lot of injuries in soccer but never injured this foot
[doctor] okay and then so after the fall and the entanglement with the other player were you able to continue playing
[patient] no i had to stop playing right away and actually being helped off the field
[doctor] wow okay and what have you been doing for the the pain since then
[patient] so i've been keeping it elevated icing it the trainer wrapped it yesterday and taking ibuprofen as well
[doctor] okay alright so without any ibuprofen can you tell me what your pain level is
[patient] without ibuprofen i would say my pain is a three
[doctor] okay and then with your ibuprofen can you tell me what your pain level is
[patient] like a seven eight
[doctor] okay so how long have you been playing soccer
[patient] really since i was like four five i've been playing a long time
[doctor] well that's cool yeah we our our youngest daughter she is almost sixteen and she plays the inner marrial soccer league they are down at the rex center did is that where you started playing or did you guys did you start playing somewhere else
[patient] yeah just like this local town leak i started playing that way and then played all throughout school
[doctor] that's
[patient] high school teams
[doctor] that's awesome so just out of curiosity with the left foot have you experienced anything like numbness or tingling or or any strange sensation
[patient] no i have not
[doctor] okay now if it's okay with you i would like to do a quick physical exam i reviewed your vitals and everything looks good blood pressure was one eighteen over seventy two heart rate was fifty eight respiratory rate was fourteen you are afebrile and you had an o2 saturation of ninety nine percent on room air on your heart exam your regular of rate and rhythm do n't appreciate any clicks rubs or murmurs no ectopic beats noted there on auscultation listening to your lungs lungs are clear and equal bilaterally so you're moving good air i'd like to do a focused foot exam on your left foot so i do see some bruising on the bottom of your foot and on the top of your foot as well now there is associated swelling and i do appreciate tenderness to palpation of your midfoot and you are positive for the piano key test on a neurovascular exam of your left foot you have a brisk capillary refill of less than three seconds dorsalis pedis pulse is intact and strong and you do have motor and sensation that it's intact to light touch now i would like to do a review of the diagnostic imaging that you had before you came in so i do notice a subtle dorsal displacement of the base of the second metatarsal with a three millimeter separation of the first and second metatarsal bases and the presence of a bony fragment in the lisfranc joint space so lem me talk to you a little bit about my assessment and plan now for for the first concern of right foot pain your right foot pain is due to a lisfranc fracture which is a fracture to one of your second metatarsal bones at the top of your foot where the metatarsals meet your cuboids now there are ligaments at the top of your foot so i'm gon na be ordering an mri to assess for injury to any of these ligaments now based on your exam and from what i'm seeing on your x-ray you're most likely going to need surgery of that foot now the surgery will place the bones back in their proper position and using plates and screws will hold them there while they heal and this is gon na allow those bones and ligaments to heal properly it is a day surgery and you will be able to go home the same day and then i'm going to have you follow up with me here in the clinic you'll be in a cast and you will need to use crutches and you will not be able to use that left foot for about six to eight weeks now after that six to eight weeks you will gradually start walking on your foot based on how you tolerate it and we'll see how you do at that point so i do believe you're gon na need surgery i i'm recommending this because there are significant complications to your foot if we do not do this poor bone and ligament healing can lead to losing the arch of your foot and you're becoming flat-footed you also have a high likelihood of developing arthritis in that foot so what i'm gon na do unfortunately you'll be out the rest of the season but we are gon na get you fixed up and ready for next season if you're okay with all of this i'm gon na have the nurse come in and get you started on your paperwork and then i will see you on monday morning and we will get your foot taken care of

MEDICAL NOTE:

CHIEF COMPLAINT

Bilateral elbow pain, right worse than left.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Dylan Bennett is a pleasant 53-year-old male who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of bilateral elbow pain, right worse than left.

The patient has been experiencing bilateral elbow pain, right worse than left, for approximately 1.5 years. His pain is localized to the medial aspect of his elbows and is described as being extremely sore, worse with increased use of his upper extremities. Of note, he utilizes heavy weights for strength training and was very active in sports when he was younger, primarily playing basketball, baseball, and football, but he denies having any pain at that time. Applying ice to the area has not been helpful, but he does use ibuprofen 800 mg 3 times daily.

SOCIAL HISTORY

The patient reports that utilizes heavy weights for strength training. He was also very active in sports when he was younger, primarily playing basketball, baseball, and football.

He is expecting a newborn baby in the near future.

MEDICATIONS

The patient reports that he has been taking ibuprofen 800 mg 3 times daily.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Musculoskeletal: Reports bilateral elbow pain, right worse than left.

PHYSICAL EXAM

CV: Pulses are equal in all extremities.
NEURO: Sensation is normal to light touch distally.
MSK: 
Examination of the right elbow: Limited range of motion with extension with pain. Full range of motion with flexion with pain. Pain to palpation along the medial aspect. No pain to palpation on the lateral aspect of the elbow. Pain with supination. No pain with pronation.
Examination of the left elbow: minimal pain with flexion and extension Slight Limited ROM on extension of the arm. Pain with supination. No pain with pronation.

RESULTS

X-ray images of the bilateral elbows were obtained and review in office today. These reveal no evidence of fracture or bony misalignment.

ASSESSMENT

Bilateral medial epicondylitis.

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, we had a lengthy discussion in regards to his current symptoms. I want to get an MRI of the bilateral elbows for further evaluation. We discussed the possibility of performing a whole blood transfusion to encourage healing, and the patient is already familiar with this procedure.

---------------------------------------------","[doctor] hey dylan what's going on so i lift quite a bit of weights i try to stay in shape as much as i can i'm not like normal people i lift heavy weights and my elbow is extremely sore which elbow is it

[doctor] pain with supination no pain with pronation
[patient] correct
[doctor] alright so dylan it took some x-rays coming in looks like you do n't have any any fractures or any bony misalignment which i expect with this kind of injury i do think that what you have is medial epicondylitis which is
[patient] is that golfer's elbow
[doctor] yes same thing have you been golfing a lot
[patient] well not in the past year and a half i've had this for a long time
[doctor] okay also known as pictures elbow

[doctor] that will be our next step so we'll get you scheduled for the mri probably get you in pretty quick here since we're a private practice
[patient] thank god
[doctor] yeah and once you get the mri i'll know a little bit more what i'd like to do is something called a whole blood transfusion have you heard of that before
[patient] no please tell me remind me
[doctor] yeah it should help with the healing of your elbow it's just a procedure we'll stick a needle in your elbow
[patient] you do a stick needle in my elbow
[doctor] mm-hmm and help with some of the healing of your elbow
[patient] so it's kinda like dry needling then
[doctor] no
[patient] not at all
[doctor] what is it
[patient] is it is that that thing where like you take the blood out of like say my my thigh
[doctor] mm-hmm
[patient] and then you literally inject it into my tendon
[doctor] yes
[patient] that it activates the healing
[doctor] yeah that's exactly what it is
[patient] interesting cool
[doctor] yeah
[patient] maybe i have heard about that
[doctor] we've we've had some really good responses from other patients on it so hopefully i mean that should be a good solution for you since you've been having issues with this
[patient] i'm excited
[doctor] yeah and we can hopefully get you scheduled for that in the next couple of weeks it's not not a major procedure and you should heal in the next two weeks so that wo n't be a problem especially considering that you're expecting a newborn soon we want to make sure you're all healed for that
[patient] wow i did n't even say that

Musculoskeletal
- Examination: Trace lower extremity edema.

RESULTS

Echocardiogram reveals a preserved ejection fraction of 55%, abnormal diastolic filling, and mild-to-moderate mitral regurgitation.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

1. Congestive heart failure.
- Medical Reasoning: This appears to have been caused by dietary indiscretion and uncontrolled hypertension.
- Patient Education and Counseling: I encouraged the patient to continue making dietary modifications, including limiting her sodium intake. She could try keeping a food diary, as previously discussed, to log her diet and associated blood pressure readings. I also advised her to monitor her weight daily and contact me if she gains 3 pounds in 2 days.
- Medical Treatment: Continue with Bumex 2 mg once daily. Referral placed for consult with a nutritionist for education and recommendations regarding her diet.

2. Hypertension.
- Medical Reasoning: This has been poorly controlled due to inconsistent compliance with medication and dietary indiscretion.
- Patient Education and Counseling: We discussed dietary modifications as noted above.
- Medical Treatment: She can continue on Cozaar 100 mg daily and Norvasc 5 mg once daily. Renal artery ultrasound ordered to rule out any issues such as renal artery stenosis.

3. Kidney disease.
- Medical Treatment: Labs will be ordered to assess her response to new medications.

Patient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.

INSTRUCTIONS

The patient will follow up in 3 months.

[doctor] well since you've been in the hospital and and they've helped you out with some with all that how are you feeling now
[patient] well i'm i'm doing better
[doctor] mm-hmm and they
[patient] i do n't do n't have quite as much shortness of breath i think maybe getting up and walking a little more is helping
[doctor] and they gave you a water pill and is that is that helping is that making you pee a lot
[patient] yeah yeah i have almost incontinence so
[doctor] goodness
[patient] yes that's not very pleasant at all
[doctor] and so they added another blood pressure medication also how are you doing with that are you feeling a little bit better
[patient] yeah i think so
[doctor] okay
[patient] if i can remember to take the pills
[doctor] yeah
[patient] that seems to be a sticky point
[doctor] well a a pill box or maybe setting an alarm on your phone might really help
[patient] okay i'll i'll give that a try anything that will help
[doctor] yeah okay well that's good to hear so now have you bought a blood pressure cuff to have at home now
[patient] yes i already had one but i very failed if i ever used it
[doctor] okay
[patient] but
[doctor] got it
[patient] i'll i'll try to use it everyday now
[doctor] okay and you might even just keep a log of what your blood pressures are and when it's up think about you know what you've eaten if you've done something different because that may help you to figure out what you need to cut back on or how you might need to change your your eating habits a little bit so
[patient] okay okay
[doctor] have you been short of breath or any problems sleeping since you've been home
[patient] no i've been sleeping like a log
[doctor] okay good alright have you had any chest pain
[patient] no no chest pain
[doctor] okay alright well let's do a quick physical exam here so your vital signs your blood pressure looks pretty good today at one twenty eight over seventy two your temperature is ninety eight . seven and your heart rate is seventy two your respirations are eighteen your oxygen saturation looks pretty good at at ninety six percent okay now on your neck exam there is no jugular venous distention on your heart exam i appreciate a two over six systolic ejection murmur which i've heard before and so it's stable and your lungs are clear bilaterally and your lower extremities show just trace edema now now we since we did the echocardiogram i reviewed those results and it does show a preserved ef of fifty five percent abnormal diastolic filling and mild-to-moderate mitral regurgitation so let me tell you a little bit about my assessment and plan so for your first problem for your congestive heart failure it sounds like this was caused by dietary indiscretion and some uncontrolled hypertension so i want you to continue on your bumex two milligrams once daily continue to watch your diet and avoid salty foods might try keeping that log we talked about with your blood pressures and what you've eaten if if your blood pressure seems a little high also weigh yourself daily and call me if you gain three pounds in two days okay
[patient] okay
[doctor] and i also want you to see a nutritionist to give you some education about what foods you can eat okay now for your second problem for i know this sounds like this is just for you and so for your second problem for your hypertension i want you to continue on the cozaar one hundred milligrams daily continue on the norvasc five milligrams once daily also and i'm going to order a renal artery ultrasound just to be sure we're not missing anything and then like maybe you know some renal artery stenosis or something and so so for your third problem for your kidney disease i wan na get some more labs to make sure you tolerate this the new medications and then i'll see you again in three months do you have any questions

Age: 40.0
Gender: female 
Chief Complaint: follow-up bilateral breast cysts
Secondary Complaints: anxiety; itchiness

---------------------------------------------
MEDICAL NOTE:

CHIEF COMPLAINT

Follow-up bilateral breast cysts.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Donna Torres is a 40-year-old female who presents for follow-up surveillance of bilateral breast cysts.

The patient reports continual presence of “lumps” in bilateral breasts with some soreness. She is being seen today for surveillance of the cysts. The patient is taking progesterone, which was initially prescribed to support normalization of menstruation, which was effective. She is also still using vaginal cream one time per week which has improved symptoms of itching and discomfort.

Her last pap smear was in 2019, with negative/negative results. She did have an abnormal pap smear in 2009, which resulted in repeat pap smears per 6 months until her results normalized.

Mrs. Torres experienced increased anxiety in 11/2021 and 12/2021, stating “it was brutal” and felt she could not manage her symptoms and sought treatment. Dr. Brown started the patient on Buspar, which has successfully controlled her anxiety. The patient relates her anxiety to work related stress and possibly aging. Her work involves supporting Covid evaluation centers and clinics. She confirms receiving both Covid vaccinations. Initially, she was experiencing spikes in anxiety prior to menstruation, but her anxiety then became more random with an unclear cause. To note, the patient was started on Singulair, which the patient was told could also cause anxiety.

The patient discontinued Camila birth control, which did result in a significant increase in appetite. This has resolved and she reports she has lost weight in the past 6 months.

---------------------------------------------","[doctor] donna torres , date of birth , 08/01/1980 .
[doctor] hi donna ! how are you ?
[patient] i'm good . how about you ?
[doctor] i'm doing well , thank you . and so , i saw that dr. brown put you on buspar . have you been on that before ?
[patient] no , that's new .
[doctor] okay . how is it working for you ?
[patient] my anxiety is going good now , thankfully . i'm serious , it was brutal in november and december . finally , i was like , "" i can not do this . "" i have no idea why it happened . dr. ward did put me on singulair , and she did say we need to be careful because singulair can cause anxiety . so i'm not sure if that was the issue or what .
[doctor] mm . okay .
[patient] and it would , um , start usually during the day , at work .
[doctor] i see .
[patient] i mean , i'm fine now .
[doctor] well , that's good , that things have settled . i do wonder if some of what you are dealing with is hormonal , and that's why i was asking . 'cause you were on the progesterone , and i feel like you were having some irritability back then too .
[patient] i did .
[doctor] and that was before we started the progesterone .
[patient] yes .
[doctor] so i know we started it for regulating your periods , but perhaps it helped with this also .
[patient] yeah . and before , in november and december , i noticed that the week before my period , my anxiety would go through the roof . which then , i knew my period was coming . then it turned into my anxiety spiking just at random times .
[doctor] hmm , okay .
[patient] and it seemed like it was for no reason .
[doctor] but november and december you were on the progesterone at that time .
[patient] yes .
[doctor] all right . so not really a link there , all right .
[patient] yeah , i do n't know .
[doctor] yeah , i do n't know either . um , sometimes with the aging process , that can happen too .
[patient] i figured maybe that's what it was .
[doctor] and we did go through the golive in november and december , so that can be pretty stressful also .
[patient] yeah , and at work , that's when i first started to lead the process of delivering the results to patients with covid . in the beginning of the whole pandemic , patients would have to wait nine days before they'd get their results . and then we opened the evaluation centers and the covid clinic . so i think it just took a toll on me .
[doctor] yeah , i can absolutely see that .
[patient] yeah , and then i was feeling selfish because i was n't even on the front lines . i mean , i was supporting people , sure , but i was n't in the icu . so i felt selfish and guilty . i mean , hands down , the physicians and nurses were in the thick of it and there i was , having anxiety . and it felt ridiculous .
[doctor] well , honestly , you feel how you feel and what you were doing was n't easy as well , so ... but let's see . i need to just put this dax back to work . all right , so no other issues whatsoever ?
[patient] no .
[doctor] have you lost weight ?
[patient] no , but i stopped taking the camila birth control . my hunger level was at a new high . i mean , i was eating constantly . i felt like , "" what is going on ? ""
[doctor] all right .
[patient] and now i am feeling better .
[doctor] okay , that's good . and your masked face , though , it does look thinner .
[patient] well , the past six months i have lost some weight .
[doctor] okay , good . um , anything else going on ?
[patient] no .
[doctor] all right . so your pap was in 2019 . i do n't think that we need to repeat that because it was negative/negative . um , have you ever had an abnormal pap ?
[patient] not with you , but i did around 2009 , and then i had to be seen every six months for a while . and then i had a normal pap .
[doctor] all right , well , let's just repeat it then .
[patient] yeah , that's fine with me , to be safe .
[doctor] okay . i know it sounds superstitious , but i feel like with all the immunocompromising , the pressure , the stress that people's bodies have been under , and the potential for getting covid or the vaccine ... i have actually seen some , um , an increase in abnormal paps in people who have been fine for a while . so that's why i figure let's just check .
[patient] okay . i fight the vaccine fight every day at home because my husband is n't ready to get it . same with my daughter . she shares the same worries as her dad in how it'll impact her when she gets older .
[doctor] have you had the vaccine ?
[patient] yes , i have . and so has my son . he , um , has had his first already .
[doctor] okay . well , you know , you can only do what you can do .
[patient] yeah , i agree .
[doctor] all right . well , let's complete your exam .
[patient] all right .
[doctor] so let's take a deep breath . and again . all right , you can breathe normally . all right , and take one more deep breath . okay , now i'm gon na touch your neck . go ahead and swallow . perfect . and just place your hand above your head . okay , i do feel some little bumps .
[patient] yeah , but they're not as big as they were .
[doctor] mm-hmm . okay , in this breast it does feel a little bit denser . does it hurt at all ?
[patient] it does , where your left hand just was .
[doctor] okay , right here ?
[patient] yeah , down here . but whenever i breastfed , it was always sore there too . i had a clog and something else . the lumps do feel smaller , but they are still there , unfortunately .
[doctor] yeah , they are . uh , well now i do n't know , because if it was the progesterone , they would've gone away .
[patient] yeah .
[doctor] all right , well just let your knees just op- relax and open . how's the itching or discomfort ? are you still using the cream ?
[patient] yes , and i actually need to get that refilled for the first time ever .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] uh , but yeah , i use it once a week and it does help .
[doctor] okay , great . all right , looks good .
[patient] good .
[doctor] you can go ahead and sit up .
[patient] thank you .
[doctor] all right , so typically the lumps would often just shrink up pretty quickly after you've had one or two cycles , and you've had two cycles so far . so i think let's just keep monitoring them for now .
[patient] okay . and what could that mean ?
[doctor] well , so just like people have an increased risk of breast cancer , there's also an increased risk for breast issues . you know what i mean ? so for example , cysts and lumps and fibroadenomas , those are all benign things . they're annoying and require some workup , but they're all benign .
[patient] and i'm- i'm just worried because i'm almost 40 and my mom was almost 45 when she was diagnosed with breast cancer . so i mean , i know there's nothing i can do about it , but it's just i feel like , uh , we had it under control and now it is n't .
[doctor] well , i would n't say that . i mean , i feel like we're at a point where we have a good cadence for you having surveillance on things , and i think you are more aware of your breasts than ever before , and things actually have n't changed .
[patient] yeah .
[doctor] so those are all good things .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] because , um , if it was cancer , we'd actually , we would see some change .
[patient] we would ? okay , thank you for explaining that .
[doctor] yeah . so i know it's annoying and distressing , but i think that's where we're at . it's annoying that you have the breast issue , and it's annoying that we have to follow them .
[patient] yeah , i agree there .
[doctor] um , but the only extra that i could po- , uh , potentially do , is we could get a breast specialist on the team and have you start to follow with them . and one of the advantages there is that they sometimes will do an ultrasound as an extension of their physical exam , in the office , to check out it- check it out on their own . uh , they also have a lot more experience and more willingness to sometimes perform procedures earlier , if they think it needs , um , if they think it needs to be done . and i think they tend to be much quicker than , you know , like radiology as to biopsy it .
[patient] okay . i'll do whatever you think i should .
[doctor] all right . well , i think since you're feeling worried , let's go ahead and we can get them on board . i'll send out a referral and they will call you within the next couple of business days to schedule .
[patient] okay , i think that sounds great .
[doctor] all right . i do too . all right , well any questions or anything else we can discuss today ?
[patient] no , i think i'm all set .
[doctor] all right , good . all right , well have a good rest of your day and just give us a call if you need anything else .
[patient] all right , thank you . you have a good day too .
[doctor] all right .",419.0,"Buspar.

- Patient Education and Counseling: I explained the side effects of albuterol to the patient. We also discussed Singulair and that she should start to see a difference in her breathing within approximately 1 month.
- Medical Treatment: We will start her on a daily asthma medication. She can continue to use the albuterol inhaler. We will start her on Singulair in about a month.

2. Mood.
- Medical Reasoning: The patient reports being under a lot of stress with school. I believe this may be attributing to her mood.

---------------------------------------------","[doctor] okay
[patient] good morning
[doctor] good morning thanks doctor doctor cooper i'm i'm you know i'm a little i'm sad to be in here but you know thanks for taking me in i appreciate it
[patient] sure absolutely what can i help you with today
[doctor] so you know i've been dealing with my asthma and like i tried to join sports but it's really kind of it's getting hard you know and i i i just wonder if there's something that can be done because i really do like playing water polo
[patient] but i'm having difficulty breathing sometimes i've had to like you know stop matches and sit on the side just to kind of like catch my breath and use my inhaler so i was wondering if there was something we could do about it
[doctor] and then like i'm kind of a little bit worried i think my mood is getting a little a little worrisome and i i wanted to explore like what my options were
[patient] okay let's talk about the asthma first so what inhaler are you using now
[doctor] i have an albuterol inhaler
[patient] okay and when when you're having trouble it's usually just around sports that is it keeping you up at night
[doctor] so i do n't really like wake up at night a lot typically like it's sports like you know if i'm doing anything like crazy aerobic or like running or anything i do notice that if any if i'm around smoke i do start coughing a little bit but most of the time it's sports
[patient] okay and can you describe a little bit for me what happens
[doctor] i start to yeah no so i start to feel like there is like some phlegm building up in my in my throat and i start coughing like my chest gets tight i start wheezing and i just have to sit down or else i'm gon na get like lightheaded too
[patient] okay and then when you use your inhaler
[doctor] mm-hmm
[patient] does it does it alleviate the problem
[doctor] so yeah it helps with that like phlegm feeling you know but i still i still have to sit down you know and like breathe and then the thing that i hate about that inhaler is i start getting like shaky is that supposed to be happening
[patient] yes that is unfortunately normal and a side effect with the inhaler
[doctor] okay
[patient] so you use you're using two puffs of the inhaler
[doctor] mm-hmm
[patient] for the symptoms
[doctor] yes
[patient] and then you sit down and does it does it get better within about fifteen minutes or so
[doctor] yeah yeah it does but you know i had to like step out of the the pool to make that happen i'm hoping that there is something else we can do okay have you ever taken any daily medications for your asthma an inhaler or singulair or anything like that no i i just use my inhaler whenever i have an attack
[patient] okay so that's something we might wan na consider but how often is it happening
[doctor] pretty much every time i do any kind of aerobic workout
[patient] okay and outside of physical activity you're not having any problems
[doctor] yeah there's that part where like if i'm around somebody who has been smoking a lot or is currently smoking but i usually just step away i do n't even like to be around them you know that makes sense
[patient] alright well we will look at that tell me about the mood issues you are having
[doctor] yeah so one of the reasons i got into like trying to get into sports is like i feel like you know you you feel a lot more energized and a lot you know happier but like lately i've just been kinda stressed out you know like i have i have like sats that i need to study for i've got like all these ap classes you know there's just it i feel like there's a lot of pressure and you know like i get it but there are times where i'm just like really down and i i do n't really know what else i can do
[patient] okay that makes sense any any difficulty with focusing or you're having difficulty retaining information or is it more feeling sad not having motivation
[doctor] so i think it's like a lot of sadness a lot of like you know i do n't really i kinda feel like you know i do n't really like want to do anything you know my friends will go out and i'll just be like i'd rather be at home i am really tired a lot too
[patient] okay alright well let me let me go ahead and check you out
[doctor] mm-hmm
[patient] and then we can talk a little bit more
[doctor] okay
[patient] i'm gon na take a listen to your heart and lungs
[doctor] mm-hmm
[patient] and everything sounds good
[doctor] let me take a look at your eyes
[patient] mm-hmm and in your ears everything looks okay have you had any problems with allergies you have seasonal allergies or anything like that
[doctor] yeah i think so yeah
[patient] i do see just a little bit of fluid in the ears
[doctor] mm-hmm
[patient] and i'm gon na look in your mouth too
[doctor] okay
[patient] and throat looks fine no tonsils
[doctor] mm-hmm
[patient] lem me go ahead and have you lay back on the table and i'll take a listen to your stomach
[doctor] okay
[patient] everything sounds okay i'm gon na feel around just to make sure everything feels normal
[doctor] mm-hmm
[patient] everything feels fine and i'm gon na check reflexes and they're all normal
[doctor] awesome
[patient] it's really hard to do with actual patient so in terms of the asthma i think we could try a daily medication since it looks like you might be having a little bit of allergies maybe we can try some singulair
[doctor] mm-hmm
[patient] and start with that once you are on that daily and you can continue to use the albuterol inhaler those side effects unfortunately you're right it's it's just one of the expected side effects with an albuterol inhaler i would recommend just what you're doing just sit down for a little bit after you take it
[doctor] and we will get you started on the singulair probably within about a month you should see a difference so i will have you come back in about six weeks and follow up and see how you're doing with that
[patient] in terms of the mood is this new for you
[doctor] yeah i think so like when i started this year
[patient] and it sounds like related to school expectations and the stress with saps and all of that
[doctor] yeah
[patient] okay let's consider having you start seeing a therapist i think that would be a good place to start
[doctor] mm-hmm
[patient] and we will do some screening questionnaires and and then follow up in a couple weeks on that too
[doctor] okay alright sounds like a plan okay

[patient] ah
[doctor] on throat examination there is bilateral erythema and edema of the peritonsillar space with exudates present bilaterally the uvula is midline on your neck exam i do appreciate some cervical lymphadenopathy on the right hand side on your lung exam your lungs you have some coarse rhonchi at the bases that clear with cough and on your heart exam your heart is a nice regular rate and rhythm i do n't appreciate any murmur or or rub so what does all of that mean teresa so all of that means is that yes you're showing signs of what we call an upper respiratory infection and i'm concerned that you might have some strep in the back of your throat based on the findings so let's just talk a little bit about my assessment and plan for you okay so for your first problem of your sore throat i'm gon na go ahead and have the medical assistant come in and swab you for a rapid strep test and if that's positive i wan na go ahead and place you on or prescribe amoxicillin five hundred milligrams three times a day for ten days and i'm gon na give you some lidocaine swish and swallow so that will help with some of the pain and you can take some ibuprofen as needed which will also help with the pain and some of that fever okay i do want you to go ahead and continue to to hydrate as much as possible what kind of questions do you have about that

- Patient Education and Counseling: I discussed the diagnosis with the patient today. I explained that her headaches may be caused by tension around the muscles around her neck and shoulders. I advised her that her symptoms do not appear related to signs of a stroke or brain bleeding. Questions were asked and answered today.
- Medical Treatment: She can continue to take Tylenol for the pain. Prescription for Flexeril 5 mg 3 times a day is provided as well.

2. Diabetes mellitus.

[patient] yes no just in the back of my head
[doctor] okay and did the headache start all of a sudden carolyn or has it been gradual or what

[patient] no i really do n't get the opportunity to
[doctor] hmmm okay understood alright well listen let's go ahead and examine you okay so so on your physical exam your physical exam is pretty normal unremarkable for the most part and you know few things a few exceptions so first of all on your heent exam your eye exam your extraocular motions are intact without pain you have a funduscopic exam that shows no papilledema that's good that just means there's no swelling in the back of your eye and on your neck exam you do have some posterior mild posterior paraspinal muscular tenderness in the cervical spine and in bilateral trapezius musculature as well and some tightness in those muscles as well and otherwise on your exam let's see your heart exam on your heart exam you have that grade three out of six systolic ejection murmur that's unchanged from your prior exam so it just means i hear some sounds in your heart as it's beating and i'm not too worried about that we'll watch that and otherwise normal heart exam and and your physical examination otherwise is normal and unremarkable and so now let's talk about my assessment and your plan so carolyn for your first problem of the headache i do think that you have a tension type headache and i think this because you've got some tension and tightness in your paraspinal muscles meaning the muscles around your neck and your shoulders and you know working at the computer i think is contributing to this and also probably the stress so you can continue to take that tylenol for the pain i'm also gon na give you a mild muscle relaxant i'll write you for flexeril five milligrams three times a day and you can take that that will help relax those muscles in your neck and that should help with the symptoms i want you to come back or give us a call if the headaches become more severe or suddenly worsen or you develop a fever but i do n't think that this is a a sign of a stroke or any bleeding in your brain or anything like that i think it's more related to tightness in your muscles in your neck now for your second problem of your diabetes mellitus let's continue you on the metformin five hundred milligrams i am going to order a hemoglobin a1c and also a cbc and a chem-12 to check some of your blood tests blood chemistries and so forth and we will continue you on the metformin i do want you to check your blood sugars daily and that will be very helpful so when you come back in a month i want you to bring those numbers with you we can talk about it again and please do try to get back into your exercise routine that's really gon na help you keep those blood sugars under control as well okay so how does that sound for a plan any other questions for me

[patient] yeah i i check my sugar two or three times a week most of the time it's in that one twenty to one forty range
[doctor] okay
[patient] yeah i take my medicine okay my diet is alright you know i could be fifteen pounds lighter that would be alright but
[doctor] sure
[patient] i i i think the sugar has been okay
[doctor] okay we checked your hemoglobin a1c last time i'm looking at your records in epic and it showed that it was you know seven . one so it's it's it's good but it could be better any you know we talked about it controlling your diet or improving your diet and trying to have a balanced meal and not eating some of these sweets and high sugar items how is that going i know you had talked about your wife being a great cook and making cookies and that's hard to stay away from obviously how are things going with that
[patient] yeah she still makes cookies and i still eat them but you know we are trying to trying to do better trying to stay away from more of those carbs and focus on you know less carby less sweet stuff
[doctor] okay alright yeah that's always a struggle i certainly understand but you know really important with your diabetes just to prevent some of the complications like kidney failure and eye problems and just keep your sugar under balance so i'll order another hemoglobin a1c today we'll check that again today and and you know just reemphasizing the controlling your diet and exercise is super important and then we'll have those results back we'll we'll see if we need to make any modifications okay
[patient] okay
[doctor] for your high blood pressure your blood pressure in the clinic looks pretty good it's about one twenty over seventy right now we have you on norvasc five milligrams once a day how are things going with that are you are you checking that periodically or any issues with that at all
[patient] yeah i guess i check it maybe once a week or two or three times a month and it it the vast majority of the time when i check it it's good usually either that one twenty to one thirty over seventy to eighty range i i think the blood pressure's okay
[doctor] okay
[patient] i have n't had any real problems there i i have had some some swelling in my ankles though
[doctor] okay is that new or is that been going on for a while
[patient] well it it started maybe i do n't know a month or two after i started the norvasc
[doctor] okay
[patient] and i was just wondering if the two might be related

[patient] okay
[doctor] alright so and your anything else bothering you today

[patient] these are like my video visit exams
[doctor] exactly so your neck exam has no jvd there is no bruits that i can hear your lung exam no rales no wheezing on your heart exam you do have a two over six systolic ejection murmur you had that in the past so i'm not too worried about that otherwise regular rate and rhythm on your heart exam on your on your on your belly exam is nice and soft on your back exam you do have some tenderness on the left paraspinal area right where i'm pressing right there your straight leg raise test is negative your reflexes are normal you have some just some tenderness in the lower back in the paraspinal area of your back when i palpate there otherwise your neurological exam is normal on your extremity exam you do have this one plus nonpitting edema of your lower extremities which is a little bit of swelling in your ankles no calf tenderness negative homans sign no signs of blood clot that's what that means so let me just review what you know explain what all this means so the back pain the first problem that you're here today for i think this is more of a muscular sprain i'm gon na recommend we start you on some anti-inflammatory naprosyn five hundred five hundred milligrams twice a day and flexeril ten milligrams twice a day as well i'm gon na refer you to for for physical therapy to help strengthen some of the muscles in your lower back i do n't think you need an x-ray at this stage why do n't we start with physical therapy and the muscle relaxers and the pain medicines if it does n't get better then we can get an x-ray but right now i would start with that if that's okay with you any questions about that
[patient] no
[doctor] okay for the diabetes the the second problem that we talked about today i'm gon na order another hemoglobin a1c continue the metformin five hundred milligrams twice a day why do n't we have you come back in about two weeks and we should have some of the results back and we can discuss if we need to make any modifications for that but right now we will continue the course and we will go from there okay for the high blood pressure you do have this one plus edema in your legs i'm gon na go ahead and order some blood work today i'm gon na go ahead and stop the norvasc and we'll put you on some hydrochlorothiazide ten milligrams once a day and if that does n't get if the swelling does n't go away i'm gon na do some more testing for right now let's get some sort off with some cbc and a bmp i'm gon na check your kidney function i'm gon na get another ekg and also i'm gon na get a chest x-ray and we'll go from there but hopefully this will go away once we stop this medication since it started around that time okay okay and i think that's it anything else we forgot about do you need refills for anything

Chief Complaint: hypothyroidism

MEDICAL NOTE:

CHIEF COMPLAINT

Hypothyroidism.
Abnormal liver enzymes.
Abnormal weight gain.
Acne vulgaris.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Christine Hernandez is a 39-year-old female who presents today for evaluation and management of abnormal liver enzymes and hypothyroidism.

When the patient was last seen, her thyroid medicine was changed to Unithroid, but due to the cost of $75, she has not yet started the new medicine and continues taking her previous thyroid medicine. She denies utilizing the coupon that was previously recommended for the Unithroid. Similarly, the patient was prescribed Epiduo for her acne vulgaris, which she did not fill due to the cost of $100. She tried filling both prescriptions at Walmart.

Mrs. Hernandez still presents with abnormal weight gain. She questioned if her oral contraceptive Microgestin, which was discontinued, could have been the cause. Additional symptoms included acne, hirsutism. She is attempting to modify her intake and plans to resume her gym membership in July as she will be on vacation. She inquired about the impact on weight loss of chromium, CLA, and amino acids.

The patient confirmed that she is taking her high dose Vitamin D as prescribed. She does suffer from constipation and she treats with MiraLAX.

She denies previous treatment for her acne vulgaris. She denies ever using clindamycin topical antibiotic. She reports having sensitive skin, developing rashes with various skin products.

PAST HISTORY

Medical
Hypothyroidism.
Acne Vulgaris.
Vitamin D deficiency.
Abnormal weight gain.
Hirsutism.
Constipation.

CURRENT MEDICATIONS

Benzoyl Peroxide.
Clindamycin Gel applied topically.
Vitamin D 2000 IU daily.

RESULTS

Dexamethasone Suppression Test: Normal.

Salivary Cortisol Tests: 2 out of 3 were normal. Not consistent with Cushing’s Syndrome.

Hepatic Function Panel: ALT 128.
Lipid Panel: Total cholesterol 222 mg/dL, HDL 44 mg/dL, LDL 153 mg/dL, non-HDL 178 mg/dL.

FAI: Normal.

ASSESSMENT

• Hypothyroidism.
• Abnormal liver enzymes.
• Abnormal weight gain.
• Acne vulgaris
• Vitamin D deficiency.
• Hirsutism

PLAN

Hypothyroidism
The patient will again attempt to initiate Unithroid. I have printed out the prescription and a discount card, which should result in a reduced price. She will contact my office if she encounters additional issues.

Abnormal liver enzymes
We have seen improvement since the discontinuation of Microgestin. I recommended the spermicide Phexxi for alternative birth control. The patient will also continue working on weight loss, which should additionally improve her liver enzymes.

Abnormal weight gain
Cushing’s Syndrome has been ruled out. I reviewed the weight loss study with the patient, she will call within a month if she is interested in participating. I advised her to follow a low carbohydrate, low cholesterol, abstain from alcohol, and reduce fatty foods diet.

Acne vulgaris
Epiduo was not covered and too expensive. The patient will try benzoyl peroxide and Clindamycin separately to see if the price improves.

Vitamin D deficiency
The patient will complete the high dose vitamin D and then should start vitamin D 2000 IU per day to maintain her levels.

Hirsutism
Her androgen levels were normal.

INSTRUCTIONS

She will repeat all labs prior to her next visit.","[doctor] next patient is christine hernandez , uh , date of birth is january 13th , 1982 .
[doctor] hey , miss christine , how are you doing today ?
[patient] i'm good , thanks . how are you ?
[doctor] i'm pretty good . so it looks like you've completed the covid vaccine , that's great .
[patient] yes , i did .
[doctor] anything new since your last visit ?
[patient] no , i did all the tests that you had recommended me to take . i have n't been able to take the thyroid medicine , the one that you prescribed , as i'm still taking my old one . um , the price was a little high on the new one .
[doctor] okay , so did ... did you try the coupon that i gave you ?
[patient] i did not try the coupon , uh , there was a charge of $ 75 .
[doctor] okay , well , next time that ... that coupon should help , and it should only be about $ 3 .
[patient] okay , um ... i do n't have it , do you happen to have another one you can give me ?
[doctor] yep , right here .
[patient] wonderful , thank you so much , and ... and then the gel , they are charging me $ 100 for it . so , i do n't know if this is because it's a ... it's wal-mart , or if i should try somewhere else , or ... maybe you know how or where i can get it cheaper .
[doctor] yeah , let's try something else , um ... sometimes it can be cheaper if we just prescribe you the individual ingredients of a medication , rather than the , the combined medication itself .
[patient] that would be great .
[doctor] so , that's clindamycin gel and benzoyl peroxide , uh , maybe by doing them separately , they could be a lot cheaper . so , that we can do . the unithroid , with the discount code , should only be about $ 9 for 90 days .
[patient] okay , that would be great . yeah , they were charging me $ 75 , and i just could n't pay that .
[doctor] maybe we'll try different pharmacy , as well .
[patient] okay . so , do you think that my weight gain could have been the birth control that i was taking before that caused it ?
[doctor] maybe . i do n't really see an endocrine cause for it , at least , so i would need to see the , the hyperandrogynism or high testosterone . or , a high dhea , to cause acne , or hair growth , or any of that stuff . but , the numbers are n't showing up out of range .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] i really do n't see any endocrine cause for it , like i said . your growth hormone was fine , but we definitely want to and need to treat it . um , i do n't know if we talked about maybe a little weight loss study .
[patient] you mentioned the weight loss study , and you mentioned that i have some meal plans , um , that you had given me . i still have those , too .
[doctor] have you tried to make any changes in the diet since the last time we spoke ?
[patient] i've been trying to get better . i will start back at the gym in july , because of my contract , i had to put a hold on it until then .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] so , i do want to start doing that . i will be a little freer since , um , i'll be on vacation after july 8th .
[doctor] okay , good .
[patient] and then my cousin was telling me to ask you about cla , because it's supposed to help your metabolism . is that okay to take ?
[doctor] um , i'm not sure . what is c , cla ?
[patient] i'm not sure what it is , either .
[doctor] okay , well , i'm unfamiliar with it , so ...
[patient] okay . i also have a coworker who has a thyroid issue too , and she suggested to try chromium for weight loss .
[doctor] so , that likely will not help too much . you can try either , if you really want to , but then ... it will not accept you into the weight loss study if you try those two .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] chromium is just a supplement and it wo n't help that much .
[patient] it wo n't , okay , thank you .
[doctor] it wo n't hurt ... okay , i should n't say that it wo n't hurt , but , it also wo n't help that much . so , it's up to you .
[patient] okay . and so , my cousin also suggested amino acids , and that i might find them in certain foods , i guess , for my workout .
[doctor] yeah . amino acids are fine , they wo n't , wo n't really help with weight loss either , but it might help , uh , you replenish , and just kind of , feel hydrated .
[patient] okay . are they proteins ? um , my cousin said she had lost some weight , and has been working out every day , but she does n't work , so ... i do n't know .
[doctor] yes , amino acids are what make up the protein , which is in any food you eat , with any protein . so , meats , dairy , nuts , any of that sort of thing .
[patient] okay , thank you . got it .
[doctor] all right . um , are you allergic to any medications ?
[patient] no , not that i know of .
[doctor] okay . is your s- skin pretty sensitive ?
[patient] yes .
[doctor] all right .
[patient] um , yeah , my size , i will start getting rashes , with different products .
[doctor] and have you ever tried clindamycin topical , as an antibiotic for your acne ?
[patient] no , i've never tried anything for it .
[doctor] okay . we might give you some of that .
[patient] okay . and i also want to mention that my feet do swell up a lot .
[doctor] okay . i'm ... let me take a look at that for just a moment . um , any constipation ?
[patient] yes , i also do have that problem .
[doctor] all right . mira- miralax will definitely help with that .
[patient] okay , yes , my doctor did also recommend that .
[doctor] great . all right , let's do an exam real quick . please have a seat on this table and i'll listen to your lungs and heart .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] all right , deep breath . all right , again .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] all right , sounds good .
[patient] great .
[doctor] let me take a look at your feet and ankles .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] all right , they look okay right now , certainly let your doctor know about this if it gets any worse or reoccurs .
[patient] okay , i will do that .
[doctor] now , let's go over your lab work . so , when you took that pill , the dexamethasone test , you passed , which means you do n't have cushing's syndrome . on that test , at least . the salivary cortisol , though , unless you did one wrong ... two of them were completely normal and one was abnormal , so , we might need to repeat that in the future .
[patient] okay , that's okay .
[doctor] all right , so , your cholesterol was quite high . the total cholesterol was 222 . the good cholesterol was about 44 . the bad was 153 , and it should be less than 100 . the non-hdl was about 178 , and it should be less than 130 . the good cholesterol should be over 50 , and it was 44 . so , your screen for diabetes is ... was fine . you do have a vitamin d deficiency , and , i do n't know if we started the vitamin d yet , or not .
[patient] yes , we did . i- i do need to take one today , though .
[doctor] okay . so , i also checked a lot of other pituitary hormones , iron levels ... everything else seemed to be pretty good , and in decent range .
[patient] okay , that sounds great . so , i wanted to also show you my liver enzymes , um , because i have n't come back since then ... but i was also happy , because one of them was back to normal .
[doctor] okay , great . let's see them .
[patient] okay . so , the one that's 30 , that was almost 200 not so long ago .
[doctor] yeah , your alt was about 128 .
[patient] okay , and , and back in october was 254 .
[doctor] yeah , this is much better .
[patient] okay , great . and then it dropped in january , and then it dropped a little more in march , since i stopped taking the medicine in december .
[doctor] okay , that's good . so ... i'm proud of you with the course of your labs , so before i forget , i'm going to , uh , just put your labs into the computer today , and i wo n't be checking your vitamin d level for some time .
[patient] okay . so , with the thyroid , and the low vitamin d , does that always happen together ?
[doctor] um , i do have a lot of people that have thyroid , thyroid issues and they have vitamin d deficiency .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] this is what i'm , um , i'm going to do . i'm going to put , print out your prescriptions , so you can shop around at the pharmacies and see if you can find better prices .
[patient] okay , that way i can go ask them and try cvs .
[doctor] yeah , that sounds like a plan .
[patient] okay , good . so , the weight loss study that you mentioned , when does that start ? or , how does that work ?
[doctor] so , we are about to start , as we just got approval last week , and we are just waiting on our paperwork so we can get started .
[patient] okay , and what's involved with that ?
[doctor] so , it'll involve you receiving a medication which has been used for diabetes treatment , and it works mostly in the gut on satiety , or satiety hormones . um , the most common side effects are going to be nausea , vomiting , diarrhea and constipation . they are s- uh , six arms , to the study . one is a placebo , the other ones are a , various as ... various dosages of the medication , excuse me . um , you would receive an injection once a week . also , keep in mind that most of the weight loss medications are not covered by insurance .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] so , it's a way of getting them , but , the odds of getting one of the arms with the medication that are in your favor , right , might be only one out of five of our hundred patients that we have on the list for the study that will receive the placebo .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] does that make sense ?
[patient] yes , it does .
[doctor] so , we do expect pretty big weight loss , because of what we learn in diabetes study . so , it's a year long , uh , process , and it's an injection once a week . you come in weekly for the first four , five weeks , i believe . and then , after that , it's once a month . you do get a stipend for partici- for participating in the study , and parking is validated , and whatever else that you need for the study .
[patient] okay , do you know how much the stipend is ?
[doctor] um , i will have to double check for you , and , you do n't have to be my patient , you just have to meet the criteria . so the criteria is a bmi greater than 30 , if you do n't have any other medical condition . or , a bmi greater than 27 , if you do have another medical condition , like your cholesterol . um , a bmi greater than 27 would quali- uh , qualify you .
[patient] i have a friend who might be interested , and she does have diabetes .
[doctor] if she has d- diabetes , then she wo n't qualify .
[patient] okay , you ca n't if you ... if you have diabetes , got it .
[doctor] correct . yeah , the only thing that , um , they can not have , really , is diabetes . so , either a psychiatric disease , or schizophrenia , bipolar , things like that .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] but , if they have hypertension , high cholesterol , things like that ... they can definitely sign up .
[patient] and they can , okay . thank you for explaining that .
[doctor] of course . so , do you want me to try to get you into that study ? or , would you just like to try , me to prescribe something ? it's kind of up to you .
[patient] i think i'll just wait for a little bit now .
[doctor] all right , sounds good . i'll give you the information for the research , it's just in my office . um , it is a different phone number , though . so then , if you're interested , just call us within a month , because i do n't know how long , uh , the , the wait will be .
[patient] okay , will do .
[doctor] perfect . so , let me go grab your discount card for the unithroid . um , when you go in to activate it , the instructions are on this card , and then you use your insurance ... then , show them this , and ask how much it'll cost . if it's too expensive , just let me know .
[patient] i will . thank you so much for your help on that .
[doctor] you're welcome . then , what i did is , i gave you a topical antibiotic , plus i gave you the benzoyl peroxide . so , the peroxide may bleach your sheets , but , you want to make sure to take it and apply it at night , so you do n't have a reaction from the sun during the day .
[patient] okay , i can do that .
[doctor] but , you do also want to make sure that you do n't mess up your sheets .
[patient] okay , sounds good .
[doctor] um , so , that's that . and then , let's see how you do on the other medications . i think this will , this will get better . in the meantime , a low-carb diet , avoid alcohol and fatty foods , and low chole- cholesterol foods .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] and again , once you finish your dose of vitamin d , for the vitamin d deficiency , you're gon na start with the 2000iu daily , so that you're able to maintain those levels . sound good ?
[patient] yes , that sounds great .
[doctor] i really think your liver enzymes are going to get better once you lose the weight , though .
[patient] okay , that would be great .
[doctor] since we stopped your birth control , we can try once called phexxi , which is kind of like a spermicide , basically .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] and you just apply it before intercourse .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] if you need some , uh , just let me know .
[patient] okay , i will . i'll let you know .
[doctor] okay , perfect . so , stay put for me now . i'm going to go see if they have discount samples , and bring you that prescription . and then , i'm going to order the labs for next time .
[patient] okay , great , thank you so much .
[doctor] you're welcome .
[doctor] so , under the plan , under abnormal liver enzymes , they have improved since discontinuation of her birth control . under abnormal weight gain , her dexamethasone suppression test was normal . two out of three salivary cortisol tests were normal , not consistent with cushing's , and therefore we're ruling out cushing's . under her hirsutism , her androgen levels were normal . for the acne vulgaris , the epiduo was not covered , so we'll try benzoyl peroxide with clindamycin , and remove the previous information . on the hyperthyroidism , we'll print out her prescriptions . unithroid should be better priced with the discount card , and we'll repeat levels of everything before next visit . thanks .",3536.217391304348,"Benzoyl Peroxide.

MEDICAL NOTE:

CHIEF COMPLAINT

Hypogonadism.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Mr. Paul Edwards is a 59-year-old male, an established patient, who presents to the clinic today for hypogonadism. He was last seen on 11/24/2020. The patient’s history includes positive for HIV, and today he is concerned with gynecomastia.

The patient is doing well, overall, and feels the testosterone is helping. He reports weight stability, feels lively, good, more vigorous, and he is sleeping well. He also thinks the testosterone is having a positive effect on his blood work. He endorses that his triglycerides have always been elevated and adds that they were as high as 265 mg/dL. The patient presented a copy of his bloodwork, showing a significant decrease in his cholesterol after 5 months. Mr. Edwards questioned if the changes in his blood work were due to the testosterone. He also noted that his red blood cell count has not increased. The patient inquired about possible benefits of Indole-3-carbinol, which is a broccoli extract for estrogen control.

Currently, the patient is dosing 140 ng/dL of testosterone per week and inquired if his dose could be increased to 175 ng/dL. He recalled that he had recently injected testosterone before his last testosterone blood work was performed; last testosterone levels were greater than 1500 ng/dL. The patient confirms continued daily use of Finasteride and Cialis, prescribed by me, and stated he needs a refill for both.

Mr. Edwards mentioned he is taking correct steps to get his life ""together."" He also uses a med calendar to help with medication compliance.

PAST HISTORY

Medical
HIV

SOCIAL HISTORY

Utilizes med calendar to support medication compliance.
Actively trying to get his life together.

CURRENT MEDICATIONS

Cialis 5 mg tablet by mouth on days he exercises, 2.5 mg tablet by mouth on days without exercise.
Finasteride 5 mg half tablet daily.
Testosterone cypionate 140 mg.

RESULTS

PSA 0.6 ng/mL.
Triglycerides 145 mg/dL.
Total testosterone 1500 ng/dL, 11/24/2021.

ASSESSMENT

• Hypogonadism.

PLAN

I recommend maintaining current management. The patient’s last testosterone levels were greater than 1500 ng/dL, although this level was likely related to his recent injection. He requested an increase to his testosterone cypionate from 140 mg to 175 mg, which I denied due to his already high testosterone levels. I counseled the patient on the risks associated with high testosterone levels and Indole-3-carbinol and it’s lacking evidence to support his estrogen levels. The last time his estradiol levels were checked, they were normal; recommend annual screening.

I provided paper prescription refills for Cialis and Finasteride.","[doctor] next patient is paul edwards , date of birth is january 15th 1962 . so he's a 59 year old hiv positive gentleman here for hypogonadism . patient was last seen on november 24th 2020 . his notable things are number one , he is on 1 milliliter every 10 days , uh , his levels were less than 300 to begin with . he's on finasteride currently . he also takes cialis daily so he takes all his pills just from me . um , patient's other area of concern is gynecomastia which is ... which we will discuss with him today . his last psa was 0.66 and his last testosterone was greater than 1,500 .
[doctor] hey , how are you today ?
[patient] all right , how have you been ?
[doctor] i'm good .
[patient] good , good .
[doctor] have you lost some weight or are you at least putting on some muscle ? you look trim .
[patient] no , i think i'm pretty much the same as i've always been .
[doctor] really ? okay , maybe it's just your black shirt . makes you look thin .
[patient] yeah , i guess that's it .
[doctor] so health wise , how is everything going ?
[patient] good , the testosterone's going well .
[doctor] that's great .
[patient] uh , it helped me out . i feel good , more vigorous , sleeping well and i think it's having some positive effects . not so much physically because like i said i've- i've been this way my whole life , but i'm seeing some good improvements in my bloodwork .
[doctor] okay , well that's good .
[patient] so the finasteride i'm only taking half a pill , it's the 5 milligram one .
[doctor] yeah , i remember you telling me that .
[patient] and cialis , on the days i work out i take 5 milligrams otherwise i take two and a half milligram pills , but , uh , i have been out of it .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] but overall i'm doing well , i'm actually taking the correct steps to get my life together .
[doctor] good . it's always great to hear . well let's take a look . uhm , i'm gon na listen to your heart and lungs .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] please use my general exam template , all right . just take a few breaths .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] in and out .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] all right , everything sounds good , no concerns there .
[patient] great . so i wanted to show you something .
[doctor] sure .
[patient] look at this .
[doctor] okay , this is your cholesterol ?
[patient] yeah , my cholesterol and triglycerides . uh , i used to have high triglycerides , you see they were 265 milligrams per deciliter , and i took my first dose of the testosterone on the 28th .
[doctor] right .
[patient] now 5 months later look at my numbers .
[doctor] wow , that's remarkable .
[patient] is it the test ? it's the only change .
[doctor] i do n't know , i have n't honestly seen many guys over the years that have cholesterol problems and this . i mean there's a big correlation between diabetic control and testosterone replacement , meaning those who get good levels of their test see their diabetic control improve .
[patient] yeah .
[doctor] but i have n't seen a lot of data on the impact on cholesterol . regardless , we will take it .
[patient] i agree . i was very impressed with my triglycerides and was just wondering if the test may be what's helping .
[doctor] yeah , that's an unbelievable difference .
[patient] 145 milligrams per deciliter from 265 milligrams per deciliter is awesome . i also read that it- it's cardioprotective .
[doctor] absolutely .
[patient] my red blood cell count has increased .
[doctor] yeah , i saw that . it's fine though .
[patient] stable .
[doctor] your psa today is also , uh , is good also . it's , uh , .6 i think .
[patient] yeah . , is it ?
[doctor] yeah , it was .5 last year and anything under 4 is good .
[patient] nice , that's good news .
[doctor] so it just needs to be checked every year or so .
[patient] so in terms of , uh , estrogen control i've been hearing that indole-3-carbinol , or broccoli extract , supposedly can improve my estrogen levels . have you ever heard of it ?
[doctor] yeah , i've heard of it but i have n't had anybody consistently use it . i mean , your levels are fine and we checked your estra- estradiol and it was not elevated , so .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] i would argue that we could test that in the fall if you want , but we do n't need to do , uh , do any more tests ... any more than test once a year , excuse me .
[patient] okay , what about increasing my testosterone to 175 milligrams ? i'm at 140 now .
[doctor] well , your levels are high .
[patient] are they right now ?
[doctor] well , i mean they were last time .
[patient] yeah but i just- just injected though , or i had right before that was taken .
[doctor] i know . i know you had then , uh , when did you inject this time ?
[patient] i figure i'm on my eighth day today .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] so i'm due to dose on thursday or friday .
[doctor] all right .
[patient] i have a little med calendar and i put checks and ts on it . that helps me .
[doctor] that's a great idea . so look , the biggest issue i've seen , even if your levels today are around 700 , is that your peaks are getting greater than 1,500 , putting you at a higher chance of needing to come off due to blood thickness . and your risk will only astronomically go up the higher the dose that we go on .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] you look well , your levels are good and you're feeling well .
[patient] yeah , i'm feeling good .
[doctor] i'm going to be blunt . unfortunately this happens often where you're feeling good but you want to feel really good . i mean , i get it and this is why people get into problems with this stuff , right ? it's like , back in the day when it was n't prescribed by doctors and people would get it at gyms and stuff and they would take huge doses . and then they would have a heart attack at 50 .
[patient] yeah , they have to be taking a lot .
[doctor] likely they are taking more than testosterone , but still .
[patient] and they are taking stuff for a long time .
[doctor] true . but right now i would not change your dose .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] make sense ?
[patient] it does , i appreciate the discussion .
[doctor] no problem . what pharmacy are you using ? have you changed it or anything ?
[patient] no changes , i use walmart pharmacy . i do need more cialis and finasteride .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] i would prefer the paper prescription .
[doctor] for all of them ?
[patient] sure .
[doctor] all right , will do . i'm gon na get your prescriptions .

MEDICAL NOTE:

CHIEF COMPLAINT

Follow-up.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Nicole Miller is a 71-year-old female who presents for follow-up. The patient was called in for a follow up with me for chronic congestive heart failure with diastolic dysfunction. Her BNP had been 3000 in 03/2021, up to 6000 in 04/2021. She was increasingly dyspneic. We had changed her furosemide to torsemide at 20 mg by mouth daily. The patient is not on a potassium supplement currently. Her lisinopril had also been increased up to 10 mg daily in 03/2021.

I last saw her in 04/2021, and she had reported being interested in having her right knee replaced this summer at East Metropolitan Hospital, so it was recommended that we work to control her cardiovascular status prior to surgery. She is currently scheduled to have surgery on 06/24/2021. She plans to discontinue clopidogrel a week before her surgery.

The patient states that she has lost approximately 3 to 3.5 pounds since her last visit in 04/2021. Some of which may be water weight decreasing. She did report experiencing bilateral leg cramps which she treated with consumption of pickle juice, which did resolve the cramps. She thought the cramps were related to her being cold.

She is still taking iron supplementation. She denies any concerns with defecation.

Regarding her prior symptoms of heartburn, she denies any recent gastrointestinal issues. She notes that her heartburn was severe at one point but resolved after trying Prilosec for 2 weeks in 01/2021. She denies any issues with heartburn since that time and has stopped taking Prilosec altogether. She has since transitioned back to her original ""stomach medication"".

The patient is due for a colonoscopy. She is currently double covered with Medicare and private insurance.

Chronic congestive heart failure with mixed presentation.
She had an exacerbation of CHF earlier in the spring. We switched her from furosemide to torsemide and symptomatically, she is doing a lot better. She is about 1.5 kg down in weight. Her breathing is nonlabored. We are going to repeat an EKG today. Otherwise, continue her current regimen. Labs were checked and creatinine is appropriate. Her magnesium is below the preferred 2 at 1.7, with some occurrence of bilateral leg cramping, therefore we will start her on magnesium supplement.

Preop examination.
She is going to be having a right knee replacement at the end of 06/2021. We will schedule a preop check the first week or two of June prior to the surgery. She will discontinue clopidogrel for one week prior to knee replacement surgery; we will provide a reminder to patient of this as well.

Diabetes mellitus.
A1c is 5.5 on last check, so there is no need for a further A1c today. She may need another one prior to her surgery next month.

Colonoscopy.
The patient is overdue for a colonoscopy, which we will try to have done at County Hospital in the next month, prior to a change in her insurance. This is just a screening colonoscopy that she is overdue for. No family history of colon cancer.

The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.

INSTRUCTIONS

Complete EKG today. Schedule a preop checkup 1st or 2nd week of June. Start magnesium supplement. Call the clinic with any questions or new symptoms.","[doctor] next patient is nicole miller . date of birth is 09/18/1949 . patient was called for a follow-up with me for chronic congestive heart failure with diastolic dysfunction . bmp's been , uh , 3,000 in march , and is about six- was up to 6,000 in april . she was increasingly dyspneic . we changed her furosemide and torsemide 20 milligrams by mouth daily . uh to note , the patient is not currently on potassium supplement . her lisinopril had- has also been increased up to 10 milligrams daily in march . also did when i saw her last april . she reported being interested in having her right knee replaced this summer at east metro . it was recommended that we work to control her cardiovascular status before surgery .
[doctor] hey , miss miller , how are you today ?
[patient] i'm doing okay , thank you .
[doctor] i asked you to come in today because we want to keep- we want you to have this knee surgery this summer but we want to keep a close eye on you to make sure a week before your surgery you do n't suddenly go into congestive heart failure and it gets postponed .
[patient] yeah , that would not be good .
[doctor] i see you're scheduled on the 24th for surgery .
[patient] yeah , that's right .
[doctor] okay , good . well it looks like you have lost about 3 , 3 and a half pounds since i saw you last in april . some of that might be water weight , but still , this is positive .
[patient] yeah , i noticed that too . i think the oxyglutinine is helping as well . my urgency to use the bathroom is much better .
[doctor] well that's great .
[patient] yeah , i , i'm pleased about it too .
[doctor] you ever get leg or finger cramps or anything like that ?
[patient] yeah , i had leg cramps the other day , but i thought it might , was maybe just because i was cold as i had my ceiling fan on and fell asleep . i had cramps when i woke up in both legs right here . um i drank pickle juice and it went right away .
[doctor] well do n't , do n't get crazy with the pickle juice because all of the salt in it .
[patient] haha , i know , i only drink about 4 ounces or so .
[doctor] okay good .
[patient] um it went away so i did n't drink anymore . i find it works a lot better than trying to put some cream on my leg .
[doctor] sure just , just keep it in moderation .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] and then are you still on an iron supplement ? and are you using the bathroom okay ?
[patient] uh yes , everything is good .
[doctor] good . how is your heart burn doing ? any problems with that ?
[patient] no , it did get bad for a while so i tried to take some prilosec and then stopped that other one .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] um i did that for like , gosh , i think it was two weeks back in january and have n't had any problems since .
[doctor] great .
[patient] um and after i stopped taking that um i went back to the stomach one , so i'm doing good now .
[doctor] okay and you're still due for a colonoscopy , correct ?
[patient] uh yeah , that's right .
[doctor] all right , let's review your blood work real quick . i checked your hemoglobin level because you have had some anemia in the past but that is still doing great .
[patient] good , that's a relief to hear .
[doctor] your potassium is 3.9 so it's holding steady on the torsemide . your creatinine was .7 not .8 so you're doing well with kidney numbers . your bun may be a tiny bit elevated at 23 which is the number we look for for dehydration sometimes the kidneys , but it's not terrible . um so when i look at your numbers as a whole i think you're tolerating the torsemide okay at the current dose . i also sent out to look at the heart failure number- i sent to look at your heart failure number . there is a test called a bmp that i was monitoring and in march it was up to 3,000 and then went up to 6,000 in april before i made the change . i'm still waiting for those results .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] all in all i think you're doing good on paper though .
[patient] what about , um what's it called , a1c ? does that show up ?
[doctor] um i do n't think i ordered it but i could . your last a1c was 5.5 in march .
[patient] all righty .
[doctor] so your blood sugar is a little bit high , it was 169 today but that kind of depends on what you ate and you were n't fasting for the blood check so i might have to repeat that test for pre-op , but i do n't think we need to do it today .
[patient] all righty that sounds good .
[doctor] i checked your magnesium level because sometimes you uh urinate out magnesium with the water pills but it was normal at 1.7 and your blood pressure is also looking good .
[patient] okay great . that all sounds awesome .
[doctor] all right let's take a quick listen .
[doctor] use my general physical exam template .
[doctor] and take a couple of deep breaths for me .
[doctor] your lungs sound pretty good to me so keep doing what you're doing . um uh , like i said , i think you're doing good overall but let's just talk about a few things .
[patient] all righty .
[doctor] so we often like to keep people with heart problems on magnesium and get their levels up to around the 2-ish range . yours is a little bit less than 2 and we want that 2-ish range because it can help stabilize the heart muscle . so i might recommend putting you on magnesium supplement . it's supposed to be twice a day so that's kind of annoying , but i know you're on other medicines twice a day too , so i think you'll do fine .
[patient] yeah , that'll be okay .
[doctor] great . now before surgery we'll have to get you off your clopidogrel for a week beforehand .
[patient] yes , okay , i have everything written down on my phone , and i have a letter taped to the side of my bed to remind me .
[doctor] perfect ! we will give you a reminder as well . we will also need to complete a pre-op check within two weeks of your surgery during the first or second week of june .
[patient] okay , i'll put that down .
[doctor] you might also have to repeat an ekg before surgery which we could do today . i know i'm sure it feels like you're doing , you're always doing ekgs . um we do n't need to any x-rays of your chest because you had one recently , and we do n't need any more blood work because we did that today .
[patient] yeah , i do a lot of ekgs . i'm basically a regular . but i'm happy to do one today , no problem .
[doctor] lastly , once we get your knee surgery , um we , we should think about getting you a colonoscopy . we can do it here locally because you have medicare . do you have private insurance also ?
[patient] yeah , i have both .
[doctor] okay so yes , you can get it , your colonoscopy , wherever you'd like .
[patient] okay , well my husband's insurance may be running out . might we be able to get the procedure done sooner ? maybe in the next 30 days ? is that okay ?
[doctor] um i can put it in right now for , uh , for county for the next 30 days , and they might be able to get you in within the next few weeks . it should not take , it should not make you ineligible for the surgery . in other words completing a colonoscopy would not delay your surgery .
[patient] okay , good .
[doctor] so let me see . i've been doing one of two things at every one , and everyone is great so it depends more on timing availability of their or for the colonoscopy . we can send you to dr. martin for the surgery who is at county surgical services down here or the other option is valley medical , and they do it at springfield .
[patient] okay , that sounds good .
[doctor] i think either direction they're good technicians of the colon .
[patient] okay , yeah whatever you can get me in , that works great .
[doctor] so i'll call around . now if you get that done and they tell you 10 years then you'll be good to go .
[patient] great , thank you .
[doctor] you're welcome . have a great day . let us know if you need anything else , okay ?
[patient] sounds good .
[doctor] all right , assessment and plan .
[doctor] chronic chf . mixed presentation . had a exacerbation of cf , chf earlier in the spring . we switched her from a furosemide to torsemide and symptomatically she is doing a lot better . she's about 3 , 3 and a half pounds down in weight . breathing is non-labored . going to repeat ekg today but otherwise continue with her current regimen . labs checked and creatinine is appropriate .
[doctor] uh number 2 , pre-op examination . she is , she's having a right knee replacement end of june . also , she would like to have a colonoscopy performed which we'll try to have done at uh bartley regional , rightley regional hospital in the next month , uh , prior to a change in her insurance . this is just a screening colonoscopy that she is overdue for . no family history of colon cancer .
[doctor] uh the next one is diabetes . a1c is 5.1 on the last check so no need for further a1c today . she may need another one prior to her surgery next month though . thanks .",344.6,"Torsemide 20 mg by mouth daily.

MEDICAL NOTE:

CHIEF COMPLAINT

Left ankle pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Matthew Murphy is a pleasant 20-year-old male who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of left ankle pain. The onset of his pain began 2 days ago, when he stepped off of a curb and landed on his left ankle wrong. He denies hearing a pop at the time of the injury, however, he describes his ankle as feeling extended and stretched. He was able to ambulate back to his house after the incident but with pain. He denies any previous injuries to his left ankle. His pain is localized to the lateral aspect of his left ankle and can be rated at 8 out of 10 without medication. When taking ibuprofen his pain level is 7 out of 10. He states he has also iced and elevated his ankle.

SOCIAL HISTORY

Patient reports that he has been working from home since the start of COVID-19 and enjoys taking lots of walks.

MEDICATIONS

Patient reports taking ibuprofen.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Musculoskeletal: Patient reports left ankle pain.

VITALS

Vitals are slightly elevated due to pain level but are otherwise stable.

PHYSICAL EXAM

NEURO: Normal strength and sensation bilaterally.
MSK: Examination of the left ankle: Ecchymosis noted over the lateral malleolus. Edema is present. Tenderness to palpation laterally. No joint laxity appreciated. No bony tenderness to palpation of the foot. Capillary refill is brisk at less than 3 seconds bilaterally. Strong dorsalis pedis pulses bilaterally.

RESULTS

These reveal no fracture or bony abnormalities.

ASSESSMENT

Left ankle sprain of the lateral ligament complex.

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I have had a lengthy discussion with the patient in regards to his current symptoms. We discussed that his symptoms are consistent with an ankle sprain of the lateral ligament complex. The nature of the diagnosis and treatment options were discussed. At this time he will continue to follow the RICE protocol. He will continue to take NSAIDs as needed for pain and swelling. He will also be placed into an Aircast for ankle stabilization and will be provided crutches in order to remain non-weight-bearing. We discussed that it may be a few days before he feels able to tolerate walking. I also advised him that his symptoms will likely start to improve significantly over the next 4 to 6 days.

INSTRUCTIONS

The patient will follow up with me in 2 weeks to assess his progress, sooner if needed.

CHIEF COMPLAINT

Right ankle pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Carolyn Jones is a pleasant 38-year-old female who presents to the clinic today for evaluation of right ankle pain.

The patient sustained an injury to her right ankle when she slipped and fell on ice while taking her garbage out yesterday. This was her first right ankle injury. She believes she heard a pop at the time, but denies any associated numbness or tingling. Initially, she was unable to bear weight on the ankle and required help getting inside; however, she is now able to slightly bear weight but ambulates with an antalgic gait. Ice, elevation, and ibuprofen have been helpful at reducing her pain. She rates her current pain as 4/10, her pain without medication as 6/10, and her pain with medication as 1/10.

Of note, the patient participates in an intramural soccer league but has not been able to play since this injury.

MEDICAL HISTORY

The patient reports that she has had several ankle injuries in the past. This is her first right ankle injury.

SOCIAL HISTORY

The patient reports that she has a history of playing sports. She played soccer in college and is now in an intramural soccer league.

MEDICATIONS

The patient reports that she has been taking ibuprofen.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Musculoskeletal: Reports right ankle pain.
Neurological: Denies right ankle numbness or tingling.

VITALS

Normal

PHYSICAL EXAM

GAIT: antalgic gait
CV: Brisk capillary refill to less than 3 seconds. Strong dorsalis pedis pulse.
NEURO: Sensation in the right ankle is intact to light touch distally.
MSK: Examination of the right ankle: Ecchymosis over the lateral malleolus associated with trace edema in that area. Tenderness to palpation over the anterolateral soft tissue. No laxity on anterior drawer testing or inversion stress testing. No bony tenderness on palpation of the foot or ankle area. Findings are consistent bilaterally.

RESULTS

X-ray images of the right ankle were obtained and reviewed today. These reveal no evidence of fracture.

ASSESSMENT

Lateral ligament complex sprain, Right ankle.

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, her symptoms are consistent with a right ankle sprain of the lateral ligament complex, more specifically the anterior talofibular ligament. We had a lengthy discussion regarding the nature of this injury and the course of treatment. I advised her to keep her leg elevated when she is seated and continue to ice her ankle. She should also continue taking ibuprofen as-needed for pain and inflammation management. She will be placed in an Aircast to help stabilize her ankle, and I am going to order crutches so she can remain non-weight-bearing for the next couple of days. At that point, she can start bearing weight on the ankle as tolerated.

INSTRUCTIONS

The patient will follow up in 2 weeks.

[doctor]
[patient] . and it kind of bent it back a bit .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] yeah .
[doctor] and when did this happen ?
[patient] it happened , uh ... that was sunday .
[doctor] okay . and have you tried anything for this or anything made it better or worse ?
[patient] i tried , um , putting ice on it .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] uh , and then i- i've been taking ibuprofen , but it's still very painful .
[doctor] okay . and , uh , is it worse when you bend it ? or anything make it ... so , just wh-
[patient] yeah , movement .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] yes .

[patient] um , i've just been taking , um , mel- um ...
[doctor] miralax ?
[patient] miralax . that's it .
[doctor] okay . miralax is sufficient .
[patient] miralax . yes .
[doctor] and any surgeries in the past ?
[patient] i did have my appendix taken out when i was 18 .
[doctor] okay . let's do your exam . uh , so , it's this finger right here . and does it hurt here on your , on this joint up here ?
[patient] no .
[doctor] okay . and how'bout right there ? no ?
[patient] no .
[doctor] right here ?
[patient] that hurts .
[doctor] all right . uh , can you bend your finger for me ?
[patient] yeah .
[doctor] all right . and how about extend it ? all right . and can you touch your thumb with it ?
[patient] yes .
[doctor] all right . so , on exam , you do have some tenderness over your distal phalanx , which is the tip of your finger . there is , uh , some tenderness over that joint itself . i do n't feel any tenderness over your proximal joint or your metacarpophalangeal joint , which is right above your knuckle . uh , you have some pain flexion as well . so , let's look at your x-rays . hey , dragon , show me the x-rays .
[doctor] all right . so , on this x-ray.
everything looks normal right now . uh , i do n't see any fractures . everything lines up pretty well . uh , so , your x-ray looks normal with no fractures . so , based on the x-ray and your exam , you have some tenderness right here . i think you've got a little contusion right here . there's no fracture on the tip of your finger . uh , so , the diagnosis would be a right hand , uh , index finger contusion on the tip of your finger , okay ? so , i would recommend we get you a s- uh , aluminum foam splint and we'll get you some motrin . uh , we'll give you 600 milligrams every six hours and we'll take that for about a week . and if it does n't get better , why do n't you call us and come back at that point ?

CHIEF COMPLAINT

Right knee pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Virginia Phillips is a pleasant 53-year-old female who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of right knee pain. The onset of her pain began 7 days ago, when she was playing basketball and another player ran into her. She states that she fell to the ground and landed on her side. She denies hearing or feeling a pop at the time of the injury. The patient localizes her pain to the medial aspect of her knee. She used ice and an ACE wrap right after the injury. Today, she notes that she has been doing exercises, ice, and Mobic for pain control.

MEDICAL HISTORY

The patient reports she is a diabetic who takes her blood sugar every morning.

SOCIAL HISTORY

Patient reports that she plays basketball at the Y for fun.

MEDICATIONS

Patient reports that she takes metformin 500 mg twice a day.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Musculoskeletal: Reports right knee pain.

PHYSICAL EXAM

MSK: Examination of the right knee: No pain to palpation of the lateral aspect of the right knee. Pain with palpation on the medial aspect of the knee. Ecchymosis and swelling on the medial aspect of the knee. Effusion is appreciated. Decreased ROM. Negative varus and valgus stress test.

RESULTS

X-rays of the right knee taken in office today reveal the bony alignment in good position. There is no evidence of any fractures. There is effusion present.

ASSESSMENT

Right knee pain, possible medial collateral ligament strain.

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I have had a lengthy discussion with the patient in regard to her current symptoms. I have prescribed the patient meloxicam 15 mg once a day to treat the pain and swelling. She was advised to stop taking any anti-inflammatory such as Motrin or Advil. I have also recommended that the patient attend formal physical therapy to strengthen her right knee. I have also advised her to continue to use the ACE wrap and wear a right knee brace for a few days. She should continue light walking with her brace on. The patient was advised to stop basketball until she follows up in 7 days.

Regarding her diabetes, she should continue to monitor her blood sugars daily. She should reach out to her primary care physician if she sees an increase in her blood sugars due to loss of activity.

INSTRUCTIONS

The patient will follow up with me in 7 days to check on her progress. If her swelling has not improved, we will consider obtaining a CT or MRI of the right knee to evaluate for a possible medial collateral ligament strain.

---------------------------------------------","[doctor] hi virginia how're you today
[patient] i'm good thanks how are you
[doctor] good so you know you got that knee x-ray when you first came in but tell me a little bit about what happened
[patient] i was playing basketball and jerry ran into me and the inside of my knee hurts
[doctor] okay did you fall to the ground or did you just kinda plant and he pushed and you went one way and your knee did n't
[patient] i did fall to the ground
[doctor] you did fall to the ground okay and did you land on the kneecap i mean did it hurt a lot were you able to get up and continue on
[patient] i landed on my side i was not able to continue on
[doctor] okay so you get off the off the court is jerry a good player you just got ta ask that question
[patient] not really
[doctor] no
[patient] he does n't have much game
[doctor] okay okay well you know i love basketball i'm a little short for the game but i absolutely love to watch basketball so it's really cool that you're out there playing it so tell me about a little bit about where it hurts
[patient] on the inside
[doctor] on the inside of it okay and after the injury did they do anything special for you or you know did you get ice on it right away or try anything
[patient] i had ice and an ace wrap
[doctor] you had ice and what
[patient] an ace wrap
[doctor] and an ace wrap okay now how many days ago was this exactly
[patient] seven
[doctor] seven days ago okay yeah your right knee still looks a little swollen for seven days ago so i'm gon na go ahead and now i also see that you're diabetic and that you take five hundred milligrams of metformin twice a day are you still you're still on that medication is that correct
[patient] correct
[doctor] and do you check your blood sugars every morning at home
[patient] every morning
[doctor] okay great and since this i'm the reason i'm asking all these questions i'm a little concerned about the inactivity with your your knee pain and you know how diabetes you need to be very you know active and and taking your medicine to keep that under control so you know may wan na continue to follow up with your pcp for that diabetes as we go through here and just watch your blood sugars extra as we go through that now i'm gon na go ahead and examine your your right knee and when i push on the outside does that hurt at all
[patient] no
[doctor] okay and when i push on this inside where it's a little swollen does that hurt
[patient] yes
[doctor] yeah okay i'm just gon na ask a question did you hear or feel a pop in your knee when you were doing this
[patient] i did not no
[doctor] you did not okay okay what are you doing for the pain today
[patient] some exercises ice and mobic
[doctor] okay okay so i'm gon na continue all of my exam when i go ahead and pull on your knee the first thing i'm looking at is i do see some ecchymosis and swelling on the inside of that right knee and when i push around that knee i can see that there is fluid in the knee a little bit of fluid in the knee we call that effusion so i can appreciate some of that effusion and that could be either fluid or blood at this point from the injury that you had now you do have pain with palpation on the medial aspect of that right knee and that's that's concerning for me when i'm gon na just i just wan na move your knee a little bit it does n't look like when i extend it and flex it that you have a full range of motion does it hurt a lot when i moved it back a little more than normal
[patient] yes it hurts
[doctor] okay okay yeah so you do have some decreased range of motion in that right knee now i'm just gon na sit here and and lay you back and i'm gon na pull on your knee and twist your knee a little bit okay you currently there is a negative varus and valgus stress test that's really important so here's what i'm thinking for that right knee i think you have may have a medial collateral ligament strain from you know maybe the twisting motion be right before you fell to the ground i want you to continue to use an ace wrap i'm gon na give you a right knee brace we're gon na wear that for a few days and then i'm gon na send you to physical therapy so we can continue strengthening the muscles around the right knee now that x-ray as far as the x-ray results that x-ray that i did it this morning in the office the the bony alignment's in good position i do n't see any evidence of any fractures i do notice the the effusion around the right knee just a small amount of fluid but we're just gon na continue to watch that i'm gon na give you a prescription i'd like you to stop taking any of the nonsteroidals that you're taking the motrin or advil whichever one of those and i'm gon na give you meloxicam fifteen milligrams and i want you to take that daily for the pain and swelling i want you to just continue exercising with the the braces and everything on so if you can you can get out and do some light walking that'll be good and then again for your diabetes like i said just continue to watch those blood sugars daily and if you start to see any significant increase in them because of your loss of activity just reach out to your primary care physician now do you have any questions for me
[patient] when can i play basketball again
[doctor] yeah that's a great question i'm gon na ask well my first off i want to see you back here in in seven days you know in a week i want you to make an appointment we're gon na relook at it we're gon na determine if that swelling got any worse and if we need to go on to potentially ordering like a cat scan or an mri of that knee to look and see if there was any significant damage to the ligament so that's for for sure for seven days you're not gon na be playing basketball now are you in a ligue or is that just you get like pick up basketball
[patient] i just played the wife with fun
[doctor] okay okay good that's a great activity like i said i wish i could play now i i also know your your family do n't they own that sports store down right off a main street that sells a lot of sporting equipment

- Medical Treatment: He will continue Bumex 2 mg once daily. He was provided with a referral to a nutritionist in consultation for further assistance with his dietary requirements to lower his sodium intake.

2. Hypertension.
- Medical Reasoning: This is currently uncontrolled.
- Patient Education and Counseling: I explained the importance of taking his medication on a daily basis. I encouraged the patient to purchase a blood pressure cuff and track his blood pressures.
- Medical Treatment: He will continue Cozaar 100 mg daily as well as the Norvasc 5 mg once daily. I will order a renal artery ultrasound for further evaluation.

3. Systolic ejection murmur.
- Medical Reasoning. Stable.

MEDICAL NOTE:

CHIEF COMPLAINT

Right foot ulcer.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Jeremy Roberts is a 79-year-old male who presents today for evaluation of a right foot ulcer. He reports an ulcer on his right foot has been present for approximately 6 to 8 weeks. He first noticed the ulcer after working outside. There is no associated pain, however, he feels the ulcer may have worsened from when he first noticed it. He denies experiencing any fevers or chills. He does however experience tension headaches quite frequently. He denies any pain in his calves when he walks. At this time the patient does not have a podiatrist for yearly foot exams.

He is a diabetic and takes insulin. His blood sugar has been running higher than normal and his last hemoglobin A1c was higher than 9. Occasionally he will also experience numbness and tingling in his feet, especially with colder weather.

In terms of his heart disease, the patient sustained a heart attack in 2018 and underwent stent placement at the right coronary artery. He is currently taking aspirin 81 mg daily. He denies chest pain or shortness of breath.

MEDICAL HISTORY

Patient reports history of diabetes and heart disease. He sustained a heart attack in 2018.

SURGICAL HISTORY

Patient reports undergoing stent placement at the right coronary artery.

SOCIAL HISTORY

Patient reports he is a former smoker. He previously smoked 2 packs a day for 20 years and was able to stop smoking approximately 4 years ago. Currently he is not very active but he does work around the house.

MEDICATIONS

Patient reports taking aspirin 81 mg daily and insulin.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Constitutional: Denies fevers and chills.
Cardiovascular: Denies chest pain.
Respiratory: Denies dyspnea.
Skin: Patient reports right foot ulcer.
Neurological: Patient reports headaches and numbness and tingling in feet.

VITALS

No fever.
Blood pressure: 127/80
Heart rate: 60s

PHYSICAL EXAM

CV: 2/6 systolic ejection murmur heard at the left base.
RESPIRATORY: Clear to auscultation bilaterally
NECK: No jugular venous distention or carotid bruits
MSK: Examination of the right lower extremity: No palpable dorsalis pedis or posterior tibial pulses. There is a 2 x 3 cm ulcerated lesion on the right lateral foot near the 5th metacarpal metatarsophalangeal joint. No associated cellulitis. No pain to palpation of the right foot. There is associated granulation tissue and some slight purulent discharge from the wound.

ASSESSMENT

1. Non-healing ulcer, right foot
2. Diabetes
3. Coronary artery disease

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination findings today, I have had a lengthy discussion with the patient in regards to his current symptoms. We discussed that his right foot ulcer is fairly sizable and will require wound care. I advised him that the ulcer does not appear to be healing and that further studies will be needed to assess if he has adequate blood supply to heal his foot wound. He was advised that due to his diabetes it is possible surgical intervention such as stent placement or bypass surgery may be required to improve his blood supply. I also advised him that I believe we will be able to heal his wound. At this time, I have recommended continued wound care and for him to also continue taking aspirin 81 mg daily. We will order an arterial ultrasound of the lower extremities. He will also be referred to podiatry for a consult.

Regarding his diabetes, this appears to be unstable as the patient reports his last hemoglobin a1c was greater than 9 and is now experiencing a non-healing right foot ulcer. We discussed the importance of blood sugar control as this will impact his wound healing. At this time, I have recommended that he follow-up with his primary care physician for further care.

The patient's coronary artery disease is currently stable. It is recommended that he continue to take his statin as prescribed. I will contact his cardiologist for medical clearance should surgical intervention be required for his non-healing right foot ulcer.

---------------------------------------------","[doctor] hi jeremy how are you
[patient] i'm really good thank you how are you
[doctor] i'm okay the the medical assistant told me that you had this ulcer on your foot that's been there for a couple of weeks
[patient] yes
[doctor] going away
[patient] yeah it's been there gosh it's like six or so weeks right now and it's and it's on my right foot and it's just yeah it's just not going away i'm not sure if it maybe even gotten a little worse from when i first noticed it
[doctor] okay and how long did you say it's going on for
[patient] probably about
[doctor] six eight weeks maybe
[patient] okay and do you have any pain in your foot no no no pain at all okay now i know that you're a diabetic and you are on some insulin have your sugars been running okay yeah they have been running

[doctor] your sugars are running higher than normal okay do you recall what your last hemoglobin a1c was was it above nine
[patient] yes it it it definitely was higher than nine
[doctor] okay alright now what do you think caused this ulcer were you wearing some tight fitting shoes or did you have some trauma to your foot or
[patient] yeah i was you know i think initially i'm you know i was out in the backyard you know kind of you know doing some work and you know i know i you know i could've stepped on a nail or you know there was some other work but you know i'm always outside so i do n't know if that kind of led to anything or caused anything
[doctor] okay alright and have you had any fever or chills
[patient] no no no fever or chills you know i kinda you know get headaches pretty often i do n't know if that you know i do n't know if that's a stress or but you know always have like the tension headaches in the front
[doctor] okay and do you have do you have neuropathy where you get like numbing and tingling in your feet
[patient] occasionally yeah occasionally especially when it's like colder outside
[doctor] mm-hmm kinda feels like it takes a little longer to
[patient] warm up but yeah i kinda have some sensation in in all my extremities
[doctor] okay alright and then are you are you a smoker or did you smoke
[patient] i did back you know kind of years ago i did but yeah i have n't smoked anything in in good number of years
[doctor] okay alright when did you stop smoking
[patient] couple years ago maybe four or so years ago
[doctor] okay alright and how many packs a day would you smoke
[patient] gosh back then yeah was at least two
[doctor] okay alright how many years did you smoke for like twenty
[patient] yeah at least twenty yeah twenty plus years
[doctor] okay alright now any other symptoms do you have any problems when you walk down the street do you get any pain in your calves at all when you walk
[patient] no no no no pain you know just kind of you know it's just i know that it's there
[doctor] okay and you said you're active you're out in the yard and things like that do you go on long walks at all or no
[patient] no no you know it's you know i just kinda feel like i've been just trying to take it easy lately
[doctor] mm-hmm
[patient] but yeah most most of the stuff i've been doing is just kind of hanging around the house
[doctor] okay alright so we talked a little bit about your diabetes let's talk about your heart disease now your heart disease you had a heart attack in twenty eighteen we put a stent into your right coronary artery you're still taking your medications for that you're still on your aspirin
[patient] i am yes yeah i do the baby aspirin every day
[doctor] okay alright and any chest pain or shortness of breath or anything like that no no yeah no nothing more than yeah i would n't attribute anything
[patient] okay and do you have a podiatrist for your yearly foot exams
[doctor] no i i i do n't okay alright alright well let's go ahead i wan na just do a quick physical exam i'm just gon na be calling out some of my exam findings so your vital signs here in the office you do n't have any fever so that's good your blood pressure is great it's like one twenty seven over eighty and your heart rate is nice and slow in the sixties on your neck exam i do n't appreciate any jugular venous distention or any carotid bruits on your lung exam your lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally on your heart exam you do have a two out of six systolic ejection murmur heard at the left base and on your lower extremity exam i do n't appreciate any palpable dorsalis pedis or posterior tibial pulses there is a two by three centimeter ulcerated lesion on the right lateral foot near the fifth metacarpal metatarsophalangeal joint there is no associated cellulitis does it hurt when i press here
[patient] no
[doctor] there is no pain to palpation of the right foot there is associated granulation tissue and some slight purulent discharge from the wound okay so what does all that mean that just means that you have this ulcer that's you know fairly sizable with i think we need to do some good wound care on it let's talk a little bit about my assessment and plan so you know i you have a nonhealing ulcer of your right foot so we need to do some studies on you to see if you have an adequate blood supply to heal this foot wound and since you since you probably do n't because of your diabetes you're here in a vascular surgeon's office we may have to go ahead and talk about being able to open up some of your arteries to improve the blood supply to your foot so that might mean getting a stent to one of your arteries in your legs to open up the blood supply it might mean mean that we might have to do some bypass surgery to to improve the blood supply to your foot in order to heal that that wound i do think that you'll be able to heal it i do n't think that we need to do anything drastic i want you to continue with your aspirin because that will help
[patient] any questions
[doctor] yeah i mean is this do we have to do any more tests or anything what are you we're gon na do an arterial ultrasound i'm going to go ahead and order an arterial ultrasound of your lower extremities to see what the blood supply is like and then i'm gon na go ahead and order a podiatry consult because i want them to see this wound and improve the wound care that you're doing and then for your next problem your diabetes i wan na go ahead and talk to your primary care physician we need to get your diabetes better controlled because that impacts your wound healing as well okay
[patient] sure
[doctor] sure understood alright and for your last issue your coronary artery disease continue with your statin and i will talk to your cardiologist in case you need a procedure to see if you're cleared from a medical standpoint okay
[patient] okay perfect

[patient] and so then i noticed that it has been getting higher the other day was even as high as one seventy over ninety
[doctor] wow
[patient] so i did call my pcp and she increased the meds again
[doctor] yeah okay now i i just have a couple questions about that are you using a an electronic blood pressure recorder or do you have somebody help you at home
[patient] yeah she i have a a electronic one an electronic arm one
[doctor] okay okay yeah that's good that's good and have you ever tried do you go to cvs at all
[patient] yeah i i do but i've noticed like since the pandemic i do n't see the blood pressures anymore
[doctor] okay okay yeah i i thought the one down on main street they i thought they just brought that one back so
[patient] did they
[doctor] yeah
[patient] that's good to know
[doctor] you may wan na check that but okay so that's good but i what i'd like you to do with that is i'd like you to keep a record of them for me for my next visit with you so let's talk a little bit about your diet tell me how how is your diet what what are the what kind of foods do you like what do you eat normally
[patient] alright do you want the honest answer
[doctor] well yeah that would be better
[patient] so i really you know with everything going on i really been trying to get better but i mean during football season it's really difficult i really love watching my games so have a lot of pizza wings subs like i said i've been trying to cut down especially on days where there is no games but it probably could be better
[doctor] okay i think we all can say that but i do wan na just hey i do n't know that if you've tried it or not but there is a new restaurant down on fifth street and it is nothing but solids and i you know when i heard this i was like okay yeah it's just another these solids are absolutely amazing so if you ever get a chance yeah if you ever get a chance try try that i mean i think you would enjoy them because they're salads that they make are just out unbelievable so let me go ahead and i just have a few more questions and i'm gon na just ask these in in order and you just tell me and then we will come back and talk about them do you have any headaches
[patient] really just when my blood pressure gets really high i have some mild headaches but otherwise i do n't have it on a regular basis
[doctor] okay what about chest pain
[patient] no chest pain
[doctor] shortness of breath
[patient] no shortness of breath
[doctor] even with exertion
[patient] even with exertion
[doctor] okay do you have any swelling in your lower extremities at all that you noticed
[patient] not if i'm on my feet for a long time i'll notice a little bit of swelling but otherwise no
[doctor] okay and then a couple other family history questions anybody in the family have kidney disease or significant high blood pressure
[patient] both my parents do have high blood pressure and one of them did have kidney disease
[doctor] okay okay and in the the the form that you filled out when you came in it says that you are on ten milligrams of norvasc daily and carvedilol twenty five milligrams twice a day is those the medicines you're on
[patient] yes i was also on lisinopril before but with the adjustments yeah those are the ones i'm on
[doctor] okay and so here's where i think we are going to go do you take any nonsteroidals like advil or motrin or aleve
[patient] yeah just once in a while for my like any knee pain or back pain that i have but again not like everyday
[doctor] okay and then lastly what kind of alcohol intake do you have you know do you consider how many drinks a week is really what i'm looking for
[patient] i'll have a couple of beers during the week and like one or two on the weekends
[doctor] okay okay so lem me do a quick physical examination so i looked at your vitals when you came in today and your blood pressure it's still high it's one sixty nine over seventy four your heart rate was eighty eight and your oxygenation was ninety eight percent so those are all fairly good except that blood pressure's a little higher than we'd like to see now when i look at your neck i do n't see any jugular vein distention and i'm gon na listen here real quick no i do n't hear any carotid bruits i'm gon na listen to your lungs okay your lungs are clear and let me listen quickly to your heart i do hear that a two over six systolic ejection murmur and we'll we're gon na have to take a little bit look extra look at that that's when i i can hear an extra sound when i'm listening to your heart and you do have a small amount of one plus pitting edema bilaterally now i did so you do have that your diagnosis is uncontrolled hypertension you know and i think you're aware that that's what your your physician's been treating you for and most of the time this cause is is the cause of this is multifactorial it's not that there is just one thing causing it so we may need to be changing your medicine around and i'm gon na talk to your doctor but first thing before we make any more medication changes i want to order some tests first to rule out if there is any specific cause for this so first order will be a renal artery ultrasound and what i'm looking for there is that there is no areas of areas of narrowing in the the blood vessels of your kidneys that would be the cause of your hypertension in addition to that i'm gon na order a you get another urine collection some morning aldosterone levels reining levels and a twenty four hour urine and these things can really show me if there is any problems with your adrenal glands again this is a lot of big words but you know i'm i i'll write this all out for you i want you to decrease your alcohol i know you like those beers but let's bring it down to maybe one a week or two a week just to get those down lower and then your salt intake you need to be very judicious about decreasing that salt intake i'm gon na give you a referral to a nutritionist to discuss those changes for that you need and and they will help you get that cleared up and then finally stop taking any nonsteroidal medicines such as your advil or motrin the only thing i really want to want you taking is tylenol for any pain right now i am gon na prescribe one medicine and that's cardura four milligrams and i want you to take that once a day and that's good to see if that can help us with your blood pressure and then finally three weeks i'd like you to return i want you to record all of your blood pressures that you take over the next three weeks and bring them into the office but most importantly if you can try to take them at the same time everyday that would be beneficial for me any questions for me
[patient] no i i just it's a lot so i i'm hoping this will work and this will get it under control
[doctor] yeah i i think you know this will be you know this we're gon na spend some time together so i'm glad to have you as a patient but you know we got ta try to get this under control and i'm gon na i'll be talking to your pcp just to let them know that you know what my plans are and we'll stay real in sync on treating this as we move forward does that sound like a plan
[patient] that sounds good thank you

MEDICAL NOTE:

CHIEF COMPLAINT

Left arm pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

He reports that his left arm pain began approximately 2 weeks ago. He woke around 2:00 am with intense pain in his left arm and hand. He applied ice and after 2-3 hours, the pain improved and he was able to go back to sleep, the pain did not return until that evening. After several nights of experiencing the left arm and hand pain, he was seen by Betty Ross, PA-C. She suspected a pinched nerve and completed x-rays of the cervical spine, prescribed gabapentin and prednisone, and referred the patient to us. The patient has benefited from the gabapentin and prednisone, reporting improvement of pain at night.

The pain initially was encountered at night, but the patient notes that the symptoms carry into the next day. He denies pain when moving his neck, turning his head, and moving his shoulder.

Mr. Clark does report a history of a left finger injury, stating “it rarely works”, and neuropathy in one leg from his knee to his foot which he receives 1% disability for. The patient is a veteran.

PAST HISTORY

Medical
Peripheral neuropathy.

SOCIAL HISTORY

The patient is a veteran and receives 1% disability.

CURRENT MEDICATIONS

Gabapentin tablet.
Prednisone tablet.

PHYSICAL EXAM

Constitutional
Elderly Caucasian male in no apparent distress. Presents in wheelchair.

Neurologic
Upper extremities: 1+ bilateral biceps, triceps, brachioradialis, reflexes bilaterally, negative. Negative Hoffman's
Gait: Not assessed today.

Strength
Upper extremities: Normal throughout the biceps, triceps, deltoid, grip strength, and finger abduction, bilaterally.
Sensation: Intact to light touch throughout the upper and lower extremities.

Musculoskeletal
Cervical: Nontender over cervical spine. Mildly restricted cervical extension and right and left lateral rotation, which is symmetric, which gives him mild lateral neck pain, but no radicular pain. Spurling's maneuver is benign.

RESULTS

X-ray Cervical Spine, 06/04/2021.
Impression: Significant disc degeneration at C5-6 and to a lesser extent C4-5 and C3-4. Significant lower facet arthropathy. C6-7 and C7-T1 are difficult to visualize in the current x-rays.

ASSESSMENT

• Left upper extremity neuropathy, suspicious for cervical radiculopathy, possible contribution of peripheral neuropathy
• Neck pain in the setting of arthritis and disc generation

PLAN

I suspect that this is a flare of cervical radiculopathy. I am going to set him up for a cervical MRI. We will tentatively plan for a left C7-T1 epidural afterwards, although the exact level will be pending the MRI results. He will continue his home exercise program as well as twice daily gabapentin. We will follow up with him afterwards to determine his level of relief. He denies any blood thinners.

This plan was discussed in detail with the patient who is in agreement.

INSTRUCTIONS

Continue home exercise program and twice daily gabapentin. Schedule MRI and epidural injection. Follow-up after epidural.

---------------------------------------------","[doctor] dictating on donald clark . date of birth , 03/04/1937 . chief complaint is left arm pain . hello , how are you ?
[patient] good morning .
[doctor] it's nice to meet you . i'm dr. miller .
[patient] it's nice to meet you as well .
[doctor] so , i hear you are having pain this arm . is that correct ?
[patient] that's correct .
[doctor] okay . and it seems like it's worse at night ?
[patient] well , right now the hand is .
[doctor] mm-hmm .
[patient] and the thing started about two weeks ago . i woke up about two o'clock in the morning and it was just hurting something awful .
[doctor] uh- .
[patient] and then i laid some ice on it and it finally did ease up .
[doctor] okay , that's good .
[patient] so i got up , i sat on the side of the bed and held my arm down , thinking it would , like , help the circulation , but it did n't .
[doctor] okay , i see .
[patient] and so , after a while , when it eased off , maybe about four , five am , i laid back down and it did n't start up again .
[doctor] mm-hmm , okay .
[patient] um . i went back to sleep but for several nights this happened , like , over and over . so , i finally went to see the doctor , and i do n't really recall her name .
[doctor] okay . yeah , i think i know who you're talking about , though .
[patient] um , she's the one who sent me to you , so , i , i would , i would think so . but when i went to her after the third time it happened and she checked me out , she said it was most likely coming from a pinched nerve .
[doctor] probably . uh , do you notice that moving your neck or turning your head seems to bother your arm ?
[patient] uh , no .
[doctor] okay . is moving your shoulder uncomfortable at all ?
[patient] no .
[doctor] and do you notice it at other times besides during the night ?
[patient] um , some days . if it bothers me at night , then the day following , it usually will bother me some .
[doctor] okay . and do you just notice it in the hand , or does it seem to be going down the whole arm ?
[patient] well , it starts there and goes all the way down the arm .
[doctor] okay . have you noticed any weakness in your hand at all ?
[patient] uh , yes .
[doctor] okay . like , in terms of gripping things ?
[patient] yeah .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] uh , this finger , i hurt it some time ago as well .
[doctor] really ?
[patient] yeah . it does n't work properly . or , it works very rarely .
[doctor] gotcha . and did i hear that she gave you some prednisone and some oral steroids , or ?
[patient] uh , well , she gave me some numbing medicine . it helped a little bit . the other two were a neck pill and gabapentin . uh , you should have my full list in your notes , though . since then it has n't really bothered me at night . also , just so you know , i am a va and i'm one percent disabled from this leg , um , issues from my knees down to my feet .
[doctor] okay . is it neuropathy ?
[patient] uh , yep .
[doctor] gotcha . that is good to know . all right , well , let's go ahead and take a look .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] all right . so , to start , i'm gon na have you do something for me . uh , just go ahead and tilt your chin as far as you can down to your chest . okay , good . and now , go the other way , tilting your chin up as far as you can . now , does that seem to bother you at all ? okay . and now , come back to normal , just look and turn your head as far as you can that way . great . and now , as far as you can towards that wall . uh , does that seem to bother you at all ?
[patient] no . well , actually , i do feel a little strain .
[doctor] okay . so , you feel it in the neck a little bit ?
[patient] yeah , just a little strain .
[doctor] okay . uh , now squeeze my fingers as hard as you can with both hands . great . now , hold your arms like this .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] and i'm going to try to strain your arms and try to keep them as stiff as you can . do n't let me strain it . okay , good . good . now , when i , i'm just touching your hands like this . does it seem to feel about the same in both hands ?
[patient] uh , yes .
[doctor] okay . all right . so , i do agree with betty . uh , more than likely , this seems like it would be coming from your neck . that's the most common reason that causes what , what you're experiencing . and i looked at an x-ray of your neck , and you do seem to have a lot of arthritis there , and there does seem to be potential for a disc to be pushing on a nerve . and now , what i do n't have is an mri , which would show me , uh , kind of exactly where the nerve roots are getting pinched off .
[patient] i see .
[doctor] so , gabapentin can help a little bit with the nerve pain , and what i would like to do is potentially set you up for an epidural . and what that is is it , it's a focused anti-inflammatory medicine , excuse me , that works behind the nerve roops that , nerve roots that we are thinking might be getting squished off . it can often help alleviate your symptoms , and i do need to get an mri of your neck . um , i know we have had one of your lower back , but i need one of your neck to see exactly where the roots are getting pinched off . so , what i can do is tentatively set you up for an epidural , but before you do that , we do need to get that mri so i can see right where i need to put the medicine for your epidural . uh , what do you think of that ?
[patient] i think that sounds good to me .
[doctor] okay , good . and just to confirm , do you take any blood thinners ? i do n't think i saw any on your medicine list .
[patient] uh , no , i do n't .
[doctor] okay , good . and what i would have you do is continue with the gabapentin . um , are you taking 300 or 100 ?
[patient] um , not sure . my lady friend helps me handle this stuff .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] i am taking eliquis , though .
[doctor] okay . um , so whatever you are doing you can just keep doing it , and i'm going to set you up for the epidural and imaging study , um , just so i know right where to put the medicine . and i will follow up with you after s- um , that's in . we can do the shot , just to make sure your arm is feeling better . sound good ?
[patient] sounds good . for the last couple of nights , though , my neck has not been bothering me .
[doctor] okay . s- um , so , presumably what's happening , then , is when you're sleeping your neck is kind of gets off-tilt , uh , kilter , and it compresses the nerve roots there . now , if you think you're doing fine , we could hold off , but at the very la- least , i'd like to update that mri of yours and see what's going on , because probably this is something that will likely flare up again .
[patient] yeah , it , it has been for the last week , so , i understand .
[doctor] okay . all right . well , do you want to do that work-up and do the epidural , or do you think you're doing fine and you want to wait ?
[patient] well , my hand is still bothering me .
[doctor] okay . so , you're saying your neck is not bothering you but the hand is . okay . so then , let's just stick with the plan . mri of the neck , so we can see where the nerve roots may be compressed , that's giving your hand the issue . and then , we're going to set you up with the epidural .
[patient] okay . sounds good .
[doctor] all right . so , keep going with the gabapentin . i will order the imaging of your neck , and the shot will hopefully help some with those symptoms in your hand , and then we'll follow up afterwards .
[patient] all right . is the mri today ?
[doctor] um , you probably ca n't do it today , but let me talk with roy and see how soon we can get it done . just give me a quick minute , and then roy will come in and get things scheduled as soon as we can .

MEDICAL NOTE:

CHIEF COMPLAINT

Smoking cessation.

MEDICAL HISTORY

Patient reports a history of type 2 diabetes, gout, and a 2/6 Systolic ejection murmur.

SOCIAL HISTORY

Patient reports he is a smoker.

MEDICATIONS

Patient reports taking allopurinol.

VITALS

Oxygen Saturation: 98% on room air.
Blood Pressure: 128/88 mmHg.
Heart Rate: 68 beats per minute.
Respiratory Rate: 16 breaths per minute.

PHYSICAL EXAM

Neck
- General Examination: Neck is supple without lymphadenopathy. No carotid bruits.

Respiratory
- Auscultation of Lungs: Clear bilaterally. No expiratory wheezes, rales, or rhonchi.

Cardiovascular
- Auscultation of Heart: Regular rate. 2/6 systolic ejection murmur.

Hematology/Lymphatic/Immunology
- Palpation: No enlarged lymph nodes.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

1. Nicotine dependence.
- Medical Reasoning: The patient has a long history of smoking cigarettes. He is currently smoking 1.5 packs per day. He is highly motivated to cease smoking as he is preparing to become a father.
- Patient Education and Counseling: I applaud the patient on making this first step to stop smoking. I reassured him that with absolute 100% certainty that I will be with him every step of the way. I explained to the patient that stress can often be a trigger for smoking. He received handouts today for common smoking triggers. I advised him to be watchful and monitor his stress level, not only regarding work, but also his impending fatherhood. The patient and I discussed coping mechanisms for when he encounters stressful situations. I encouraged him to maintain his gym routine, engage in meditation, and try adding in yoga to help further reduce his stress levels. We discussed additional cessation aids.
- Medical Treatment: The patient has chosen his birthday, as a quit date. On that day, I am going to start him with a 21 mg nicotine patch, and the goal will be to decrease that over time. We will work together to decrease the dosage of the nicotine patch, so there are not necessarily any hard dates in mind. I recommend he change the patch location each day as that will help reduce or avoid any skin irritation that can occur if he re-uses the same location repeatedly.

2. Type 2 diabetes.
- Medical Reasoning: Stable.
- Patient Education and Counseling: We discussed that continuing to follow a healthy diet and perform regular exercise will help to maintain his blood glucose levels.
- Medical Treatment: We will continue to monitor his type 2 diabetes. Hemoglobin A1c is ordered to be completed by his next visit in 2 weeks.

3. History of gout.
- Medical Reasoning: Stable with medication.
- Patient Education and Counseling: I advised him to continue to watch for foods that will exacerbate his uric acid levels.
- Medical Treatment: He will continue his allopurinol.

Patient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.

INSTRUCTIONS

I would like to see him again in 2 weeks to discuss how things are going and to reevaluate the nicotine patch dosage.

CHIEF COMPLAINT

Right hip pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Elizabeth Reyes is a 56-year-old female who presents for the evaluation of pain in her right hip and groin region. Her symptoms started on 02/2020 and has progressively worsened. She is employed as an RN and notes that her symptoms began while she was working and walking around the infusion room at Johnson. Initially the pain would only happen when she took a step back, but the pain has progressed and now occurs with any type of movement involving her right hip and groin. She describes that her hip will sometimes “catch” when she moves, causing her to fall on occasion. The pain improves when she is still and stops moving. She rates her pain as 2-7/10.

Starting in 2018, the patient intentionally lost 110 pounds through Weight Watchers. She has maintained the weight loss and her weight has been stabile for the past 1 year. She has a history of several bulging discs, but the pain has significantly reduced due to her weight loss. Today, she reports no back pain.

She denies fever, chills, new onset of bowel or bladder dysfunction, tingling or numbness.

Cervical spine exam: No tenderness is elicited. Range of motion is full in all planes without pain. Spurling's test is negative.
Lumbar spine exam: Range of motion is decreased in extension and lateral flexion without pain. No tenderness is elicited in the midline.
Sacroiliac joint exam: Bilateral sacroiliac joints are nontender to palpation.
Bilateral hip exam: Range of motion is decreased in the right hip with pain in the groin on internal and external rotation. Resisted right hip flexion causes pain in the right groin region. Bilateral trochanteric regions are nontender to palpation.

Neurological
Motor bulk and tone are normal in both lower extremities. Motor strength testing reveals no focal motor weakness in the lower extremities. Deep tendon reflexes are 1+ throughout. No focal sensory deficit is noted.

RESULTS

MR arthrogram of the right hip completed on 06/03/2021 reveals evidence of high-grade chondromalacia involving the anterosuperior right acetabulum with subchondral marrow edema and cyst formation.

ASSESSMENT

• Right hip degenerative joint disease.

PLAN

I discussed the clinical and radiological findings with the patient. Treatment options discussed are low impact exercises, use of analgesics as needed, and use of a cane to offload the right hip. She would like to proceed with a cortisone injection into her right hip joint. We will administer the injection today. I reviewed the procedure in detail, including the risks of the injection related to the use of steroid in the COVID setting. She understands the risks and would like to proceed with the injection.

INSTRUCTIONS

Schedule a follow up appointment in 3 months to assess her pain. If needed, a second injection may be administered.","[doctor] good morning ms. reyes !

[patient] i'm good today
[doctor] you're good today yeah you've been going through a lot lately i know you just had your treatment how how are your symptoms
[patient] my symptoms are pretty good today i just kind of have a minimal cough and a sore throat
[doctor] okay
[patient] but that's all i'm feeling today
[doctor] okay and how about fatigue have you been feeling more tired
[patient] yes a little bit
[doctor] okay and how about any nausea or vomiting
[patient] no not as of today
[doctor] okay and i know you were mentioning a cough before how is it as far as walking are you having any shortness of breath
[patient] i have n't noticed any shortness of breath it just kind of seems to be a lingering kind of light dry cough
[doctor] cough okay is it any mucus with it or is it a dry cough
[patient] more dry
[doctor] a dry cough okay and tell me more about this sore throat
[patient] this kind of seems to be persistent comes and goes it will be worse sometimes and then others it feels better trying to drink lots of fluids
[doctor] okay
[patient] to see if it can it you know the dry coughing if it's part of that or what i can do
[doctor] okay and when you mention drinking and eating is do you feel like anything is getting stuck there
[patient] no i do n't feel like anything is getting stuck right now and i have n't been i have been eating but not as much as i normally would
[doctor] okay okay alright and how are you doing as far as like just emotionally and mentally how are you doing i'm just talking a little bit about your support systems
[patient] the nursing staff and the office has been very good to help you know with anything that i need as far as support so just since we are just getting started so far on the journey i do feel like i have support and mentally you know still feel strong
[doctor] okay and how about with family or friends have you been able to turn to anyone
[patient] i do have good family members that have been supportive and they have come to my treatment with me
[doctor] okay excellent excellent and so right now you're on a combination of two different chemotherapies the cisplestan as well as the eupside and you had your last treatment just a few days ago but you're saying right now you've been able to tolerate the nausea and the fatigue
[patient] yes i have n't had any nausea but you know just slight fatigue it does n't seem to be overwhelming
[doctor] okay okay so we are gon na go ahead if it's okay with you and start your physical exam reviewing your vitals so vitals look good especially your oxygen especially with the chemotherapy you've been getting and the cough so your oxygen looks good so i'm happy with that so now i'm just examining your neck especially with your sore throat and i do n't appreciate any cervical lymphadenopathy and also no supraclavicular adenopathy listening to your heart you have a nice regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs that i appreciate now on your lung exam when you're taking some deep breaths i do notice some crackles in your lungs bilaterally and what that means is there is there is some faint sounds that i'm hearing which could represent some fluid there so on looking at your skin exam on your chest you do have some erythema on the anterior side of the chest on the left side and this could be related to the radiation so on your lower extremities i appreciate no edema and everything else looks good and thank you i know you did a chest x-ray before coming in so on your results for the chest x-ray it does look like you have some mild radiation pneumonitis which basically means some inflammation of the lungs most likely due to the radiation so what does this all mean so for your assessment and plan so for the first diagnosis the first problem of the lung cancer so what we're gon na do is we're gon na continue with the current regimen of your chemotherapy of the cisplacin and the etoside and we're gon na continue with your current dose of radiation at forty five grade and when that's complete we will repeat some imaging and hopefully you know the tumor will shrink down enough that we can remove it surgically okay for problem number two so the radiation pneumonitis so that's what causing that cough as well as some of the shortness of breath i know you're not experiencing it much now so what i'm gon na do for that is actually gon na prescribe you a low dose of prednisone and so that's an will help with the inflammation i'm gon na give you forty milligrams daily for five days and so hopefully that will help reduce the inflammation and so that you can continue with the radiation okay how does that sound so far
[patient] that sounds great thank you
[doctor] okay and then lastly for the painful swallowing that you're having so the inflammation you're having it not only in your lungs but it also in your esophagus as well so what i'm gon na do is prescribe you you're taking the the prednisone i'm also gon na give you a lidocaine swish and swallow and you can do that four times a day and so that will be able to help you so you can eat immediately after taking it and it can also help so that you can continue to take food and fluids prevent dehydration and any further weight loss
[patient] great
[doctor] okay any questions for me
[patient] i do n't believe so at this time

MEDICAL NOTE:

CHIEF COMPLAINT

History of right ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS).

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Sophia Brown is a 75 y.o. female who presents today for a new patient evaluation due to her history of right DCIS. She is doing well but wishes to establish care today for continued monitoring.

The patient underwent a screening mammogram in 10/2019 and was found to have a calcification in the right breast. She then had a right breast ultrasound on 11/03/2019 which revealed a mass at the 2 o’clock position, 11 cm from the nipple, in the retroareolar region. The report states the mass was 0.4 by 2.0 by 3.0 centimeters. She subsequently had an ultrasound-guided core needle biopsy on 12/05/2019 and pathology results revealed grade 2 ER-positive, PR-positive DCIS. The patient then had a lumpectomy with lymphadenectomy performed on 01/20/2020. The tumor was 8 mm with negative margins and the 5 lymph nodes removed were all benign. Pathology from the tumor confirmed DCIS. Her lumpectomy was followed by adjuvant radiation therapy. Endocrine therapy was also offered but the patient declined. She has since had a mammogram in 01/2021 which was normal. The patient also reports that she performs self-breast exams regularly at home.

Mrs. Brown is a G5P5 female and estimates that her last menstrual period was approximately 30 years ago. She is not currently and has never been on hormone replacement therapy.

The patient’s last colonoscopy was done in 2018. She had a sigmoid polypectomy at that time and pathology showed a tubular adenoma.

Her cholesterol was recently noted to be elevated and the patient reports that she is exercising and reducing fatty food intake accordingly. This is being followed by her primary care provider.

[doctor] wonderful . i'm doctor stewart . it's lovely to meet you .
[patient] you as well .
[doctor] so , you've come to see me today because you had a right breast lumpectomy last year . is that right ?
[patient] yes . on january 20th , 2020 .
[doctor] okay . and how have you been since then ? any problems or concerns ?
[patient] no , i'm feeling good . i do my self breast exams religiously now and have n't felt anything since .
[doctor] perfect . i want to back up and go over your history so i can make sure everything in your chart is correct and i do n't miss anything . so , i'll tell you what we have in your chart from your other providers and you tell me if anything is wrong or missing . sound good ?
[patient] sounds good .
[doctor] great . so , i have that you were found to have a calcification in your right breast during a mammogram in october 2019 . was that just a normal screening mammogram , or was it done because you felt a lump ?
[patient] it was just a normal one you're supposed to get every so often .
[doctor] i see . and then it looks like you had an ultrasound of your right breast on november 3rd , 2019 , which revealed a mass at the two o'clock position , 11 centimeters from the nipple in the retroareolar region . the report states the mass was point four by two by three centimeters .
[patient] yes , that sounds right . hard to remember now , though .
[doctor] yep , definitely .
[doctor] based on those results , they decided to do an ultrasound-guided core needle biopsy on december 5th , 2019 . pathology results during that biopsy came back as grade two , er positive , pr positive , dcis , or ductal carcinoma in situ .
[patient] yes . unfortunately .
[doctor] i know . scary stuff . but you had a lumpectomy on january 20th , 2020 , which removed the eight millimeter tumor and margins were negative . the pathology confirmed dcis . looks like they also removed 5 lymph nodes , which , thankfully , were negative for malignancy . that's great !
[patient] yeah , i was definitely very relieved .
[doctor] and your last mammogram was in january 2021 ? and that was normal .
[patient] yes .
[doctor] okay . so , i feel like i have a good grasp of what's been going on with you now . and you're here today to establish care with me so i can continue to follow you and make sure you're doing well , right ?
[patient] yes . fingers crossed .
[doctor] definitely . we'll keep a close eye on you and take good care of you .
[patient] okay , sounds good .
[doctor] i have a few more questions for you . when was your last colonoscopy ?
[patient] i had one in 2018 and , if i remember correctly , i had one polyp and that was removed and it was n't cancerous .
[doctor] okay , yes , i see that report now . one polyp in the sigmoid colon which had a benign tubular adenoma . okay . and when was your last menstrual period ?
[patient] gosh . it was probably around 30 years ago .
[doctor] okay . do you have children ?
[patient] i do . i have five .
[doctor] ah , big family then . that's nice .
[patient] yes . and they're all having kids of their own now , so it's getting even bigger .
[doctor] i bet . sounds like fun .
[patient] it is .
[doctor] did you have any other pregnancies that were miscarriages or terminations ?
[patient] really , i did not .
[doctor] okay . so for the record , that's g5 p5 . and now that you're post-menopausal , are you currently or have you ever been on hormone replacement therapy ?
[patient] my primary care doctor gave me the option years ago but i decided against it .
[doctor] okay . and on your review systems form , you indicated that you've not had any recent weight loss or gain , headaches , bone pain , urinary symptoms , or blood in the stools . but you did indicate that you have some back pain , joint pain , and high cholesterol . tell me some more about those .
[patient] okay . so i've seen doctors for all of those . they've said , excuse me , the back and knee pain are age-related . and the cholesterol is a fairly new diagnosis , but i am working on exercise and cutting back on fatty foods to see if i can get it lower without any medication .
[doctor] okay . and your primary care doctor is following you for that , right ?
[patient] that's correct .
[doctor] okay . for medications , i have that you take coq10 , vitamin d , vitamin c , fish oil , and elderberry fruit . is that all right ?
[patient] yes , and that's all .
[doctor] okay . so for your medical history , it's high cholesterol and stage 0 er/pr positive invasive ductal carcinoma of the right breast . any surgeries other than the lumpectomy ?
[patient] i did have my tubes tied after my last baby , but that's all .
[doctor] okay . and how about family history ?
[patient] my mom had non-hodgkin's lymphoma and my dad had prostate cancer and heart disease , but i think that's it .
[doctor] all right . any family history of breast cancer ?
[patient] none .
[doctor] did any of your children have medical issues or siblings with medical problems ?
[patient] i do not have any siblings and , thankfully , my children are all healthy .
[doctor] wonderful . do you have any history of smoking , illicit drug use , heavy alcohol consumption ?
[patient] no drugs . i do drink socially , but never more than that . and i used to smoke , but really , everybody did back then and i probably quit about 30 years ago .
[doctor] excellent . i have that you're allergic to penicillin . any other allergies ?
[patient] nope , just penicillin .
[doctor] okay . i think that covers it . hop up here and let me take a look at you .
[doctor] okay , so let's use the normal new patient exam template . only change to make is the breast exam . there are no palpable masses , however , there is skin thickening at the medial inferior aspect of the right breast which may be radiation skin changes .
[doctor] in the result section , note that her ecog performance status today is zero .
[doctor] do you have ... did you have radiation after the lumpectomy ?
[patient] i did . we also talked about endocrine therapy , but i decided against that .
[doctor] okay . so your exam looks good , no masses , just some skin changes from that radiation . now , let's go over the plan for you .
[patient] okay , sounds good .
[doctor] as you know , you've had dcis which we'll list in my note as stage zero , er/pr positive , invasive ductal carcinoma of the right breast . your status post-lumpectomy with removal of five lymph nodes that were benign . you also had , um , radiation therapy but declined endocrine therapy . today's clinical examination shows no evidence of recurrence with the dcis or other malignancy and your mammogram in january , 2021 was also negative for recurrence and malignancy .
[doctor] so , based on all of that , we can just continue to observe you .
[patient] okay . that sounds great . and when do i come back in to see you ?
[doctor] in a year , but you should have another mammogram in april of 2022 before you come back to see me .
[patient] okay , i can do that .
[doctor] wonderful . i'm glad to see you doing so well . do you have any questions or concerns i can address for you today ?
[patient] i do n't think so .
[doctor] okay , great . my nurse will be in shortly to discharge you . take care !

Age: 45.0
Gender: male
Chief Complaint: right elbow pain
Secondary Complaints: nan

---------------------------------------------
MEDICAL NOTE:

CHIEF COMPLAINT

Right elbow pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Lawrence Butler is a pleasant 45-year-old male who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of right elbow pain.

Over the past week, the patient has developed 6/10 pain in the ""inside"" of his right elbow. The pain may radiate into his forearm on occasion, but does not extend up to his shoulder. He denies any history of trauma or injury, but he did start making pottery during the COVID-19 pandemic and suspects that his symptoms could be related to that. His symptoms affect his ability to lift objects or perform his typical activities of daily living. Ibuprofen provides minimal symptomatic relief.

SOCIAL HISTORY

The patient reports that he began making pottery during the COVID-19 pandemic.

MEDICATIONS

The patient reports that he has been taking ibuprofen.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Musculoskeletal: Reports right elbow pain.

VITALS

Normal

PHYSICAL EXAM

MSK: Examination of the right elbow: Moderate tenderness at the medial epicondyle. No pain with supination of the forearm. Pain with pronation of the forearm. Pain with resistance against flexion of the wrist.

RESULTS

X-ray imaging of the right elbow was obtained and reviewed in office today. These reveal no evidence of fracture or bony abnormality.

ASSESSMENT

Right medial epicondylitis.

PLAN

The patient and I discussed his diagnosis in detail, and I explained that his symptoms are likely caused by overuse and potential damage of the tendons. We will provide him with sling to be worn during the day while he is awake. I want him to take ibuprofen 600 mg every 6 hours with food for a full week and ice the elbow for 20 minutes, 3 times daily. Finally, I advised the patient to rest his elbow and avoid doing any pottery for the next couple of weeks.

INSTRUCTIONS

The patient will follow up in 1 week.

---------------------------------------------","[doctor] hey lawrence how're you doing

[doctor] okay and then and how long has this pain been going on
[patient] about four days now
[doctor] alright and anything you've done to help relieve or alleviate that pain any anything that that's giving you relief
[patient] i've tried ibuprofen that helps a little but not much
[doctor] okay so if it's okay with you i would like to do a a quick physical exam your vitals look good and i'm gon na do a focused exam on that right elbow i'm gon na go ahead and and and press here do you do you have any pain when i press here

[patient] and i've been in a lot of pain it started about i would say probably about three days ago
[doctor] okay
[patient] started having pain on my left back
[doctor] okay
[patient] and since then i continued to have pain it is traveling a little lower it's gotten little low but i definitely have not passed it yet and i'm just in so much pain
[doctor] okay so is the pain that you're having is it constant or does it come and go
[patient] it's constant
[doctor] okay
[patient] all the time i ca n't get comfortable
[doctor] alright are you able to urinate
[patient] i am and this morning i actually started seeing some blood
[doctor] okay yeah so and i know you said i see you've had some kidney stones in the past like how many times would you say you've had one of these episodes
[patient] i've had it for probably this might be my third time
[doctor] third time alright
[patient] yeah i have n't had one in a while but yeah this is my third time
[doctor] okay so have you noticed any nausea chills fever
[patient] no fever some chills and i i just in so much pain i i ca n't eat and i do feel a little nauseous
[doctor] okay that sound definitely understandable so you've been in a lot of pain so have you tried to take any medications to alleviate the pain
[patient] yeah i've been taking tylenol i have had to try some ibuprofen i know you said to be careful with my blood pressure but i have been trying to do that because i'm just in so much pain and it's not really working
[doctor] okay and before what would you how long would you say it took you to pass the other stones or how was that that resolved
[patient] yeah usually usually about about three four days to pass it yeah
[doctor] right so this is this is the looks like this is the third day
[patient] yeah
[doctor] so we are getting close there
[patient] okay
[doctor] yeah so hopefully we can pass it but we'll i'll definitely we can take a look at it here in a second so while you are here i also wanted to check up on your your diabetes and and hypertension you have so i'm looking here at my notes and you're on two . five of norvasc for your high blood pressure when you came in today your blood pressure was a was a little bit high and i know that's probably because you are in a bunch of pain so that definitely makes sense but i think last time we talked a little bit about you getting a blood pressure cuff and taking your blood pressures regularly so those readings first off were you able to get the blood pressure cuff
[patient] i was i have n't been great about taking it but i did get the blood pressure cuff
[doctor] so the time that you did take it and i think that's something we got to work on is you've taken them i think at least three times a week i would like you to what have those been running
[patient] like the top numbers they're usually the one thirties sometimes i get i do go into one forties and once it went to like one fifty
[doctor] okay
[patient] and then the bottom number has been between seventy and eighty okay that i mean that's not too bad i think when you were first diagnosed you were up there in the
[doctor] the one eighties which was really high
[patient] right
[doctor] so let me talk a little bit also about you trying to lower your salt intake to like like twenty three hundred milligrams a a day so have you been able to do that
[patient] trying my best but doc i really like my french fries
[doctor] yeah
[patient] like
[doctor] we we all like we all like the french fries you know but you know we we we we also do n't like strokes so we do n't want to have a scope and all the all the french fries so that's something definitely i would like you to work on and do you think you'd be able to to curb that french fry habit or that bad this bad food habits by yourself or do you think you need help
[patient] yeah some help could be helpful okay yeah we can definitely get you connected with someone just to help you with your diet kinda that's the biggest thing for a lot of my patient is trying to control that diet alright
[doctor] so i also want to take a look here at your diabetes and last time you came in your a1c was a little bit higher at seven . three and you're on five hundred of metformin currently so have you been taking your blood sugars before you eat everyday
[patient] i have and those those have been pretty good they are like in the low one hundreds
[doctor] okay that that that's definitely good because when you came in i think we did a glucose test on you couple of months ago and you were around three hundred which is which is pretty up there so i'm glad that you know those levels are down and have you been taking that metformin everyday
[patient] i do
[doctor] okay
[patient] i do take it
[doctor] that that that that's really good alright so let me do a quick physical exam on you just a couple of questions before i take a look at your your abdomen and and your back talked to take a look at that that kidney stones you're having so i just want to make sure are you having any any chest pain
[patient] no chest pain
[doctor] no chest pain are you having any belly pain
[patient] the back pain is starting to kind of go down into my groin but i would n't say any back pain i mean abdominal pain
[doctor] no abdominal pain alright so let me check here i'm gon na listen to your heart real quick and so on your heart exam i do hear a grade two out of six systolic ejection murmur and that we knew about that already so not really worried about that currently listen to your lungs your lungs are clear bilaterally i do n't hear any crackles or wheezes so let me press here on your abdomen does that hurt
[patient] yes
[doctor] okay i'm gon na press here on your back is that painful
[patient] yes
[doctor] alright so on your examination of your abdomen there is tenderness to palpation of the abdomen there is n't any rebound or guarding though and only there is also cva tinnitus on the right on your on your flank as well and so it seems to me you know that you do have that kidney stone looks like you do have some inflammation around your kidney that's what that that's that tenderness around your cva is is telling me so let's go talk a little bit about my assessment and plan for you so you know right now because of your history of of having kidney stones you you do have a kidney stone so what we're gon na do is first off i'm gon na get you some pain medication kinda you're in a ton of pain right now i'm gon na prescribe you some oxycodone five milligrams you can take that every six to eight hours as needed for pain and so hopefully that can help you feeling better and you can continue to take that tylenol for any breakthrough pain that you're having i do wan na make sure that you're pushing fluids right now because we need to try to push that stone out that you're having just kinda clear your kidneys and that that would definitely help i also want to give you a strainer so you can strain your urine to see if you do actually pass that stone and then i'm going to refer you to urology and we're actually i'm gon na have you you even if you pass a stone in the next couple of days i want you to go anyway because it seems like you're having recurrent kidney stones and so hopefully they can help do something to to help this from happening in the future for your hypertension i'm gon na keep you on that two . five norvasc your your blood pressures look good so i'm not gon na make any changes there and then for your diabetes we'll keep you on the five hundred of metformin and i also want to give you a referral to nutrition to a dietitian and they will be able to help you with your your diet i know you said you have a few issues so you know they can possibly write a diet for you and if you follow it you know hopefully in the future we can get you off of both of these medications and get you back to normal so how does that all sound

ASSESSMENT

• Iron deficiency anemia

Mrs. Cooper is a 65-year-old female who was diagnosed with iron deficiency anemia in 12/2019 and was unable to donate blood. Her follow-up blood work in 01/2020 revealed a low hemoglobin, stable hematocrit, and normal iron labs, although, ferritin was low. She has been taking ferrous sulfate 325 mg by mouth.

PLAN

I have asked her to continue each ferrous sulfate dose with vitamin C found in orange juice for the next 12 weeks then recheck CBC, iron ferritin, B-12, and folate. A referral was sent for her to see a hematologist. We will plan for EGD and colonoscopy to assess for potential sources of anemia or GI bleed. If this is inconclusive, capsule endoscopy can be considered.

INSTRUCTIONS

Schedule upper endoscopy, colonoscopy and appointment with hematologist. Return to the clinic if symptoms worsen.

[patient] recently i tried to donate blood , around december i think , and they told me i was anemic , which is something i've been dealing with for a while , so it's not the first time i've been told i'm anemic .
[doctor] or how have you been feeling in general with this ?
[patient] not great . i have been feeling fatigued often during the day , and even feverish with chills at times . when i try to be active i like i ca n't catch my breath and i feel like i'm wheezing . i've had some headaches too , which is not like me .
[doctor] okay . are there any other symptoms ?
[patient] i've been noting some chilling sensations . i also get cold so easily . it's annoying . i feel like i have to really bundle up . i do n't know if this is related but my anxiety and depression feel like it has been getting worse lately . i feel like a mess .
[doctor] sounds like you're not feeling great , obviously . and i'm glad you came to see us . um , we're certainly going to try to figure this out and figure out what's going on , uh , but it sounds like you've been dealing with this anemia for a long time ?
[patient] yeah , i've been anemic since i was 13 years old .
[doctor] right . so why do your doctors think you're anemic ? do you have a history of heavy periods ?
[patient] well i did have heavy periods until i had a hysterectomy in 1996 . but no , they have not told me why they think i'm anemic , which is frustrating honestly .
[doctor] yeah . i can imagine that is . um , let's see if we can help though . since you had your hysterectomy your periods , of course , are no longer the issue . um , when was your last colonoscopy ?
[patient] about five to six years ago .
[doctor] and was it relatively a normal exam ? did you have any polyps ?
[patient] no . they said they'd see me in 10 years .
[doctor] well that's good news .
[patient] yeah , i agree .
[doctor] um , do you have a pacemaker or defibrillator , or have sleep apnea , or use oxygen at night ?
[patient] no .
[doctor] all right . do you ever drink alcohol ?
[patient] yeah , but only once or twice a year .
[doctor] okay . are you taking any supplements such as iron or vitamin b12 ?
[patient] i already started taking my iron pills which i have not taken in about a year .
[doctor] all right . and what are you taking ?
[patient] i'm taking 25 milligram tablets , twice daily .
[doctor] okay , and that's the , the ferrous sulfate ?
[patient] yeah , that's it . i take one in the morning and one in the evening .
[doctor] okay . anything else ?
[patient] yeah , i take vitamin b12 , just the over the counter stuff .
[doctor] okay , very good . all right , well let's go ahead and take a look and see what's going on .
[patient] sounds good . thank you .
[doctor] of course . you'll hear me , uh , talk through your exam so that i get all the information documented .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] all right . so use my general physical exam template . i will start by listening to your heart and lungs .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] all right . next , i'd like you to lay back so i can examine your abdomen .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] is there any tenderness where i'm pressing ?
[patient] no .
[doctor] okay . you can sit up . so your physical exam is normal without any significant findings . all right ms. cooper , often when we initially see anemia and your host of symptoms , we suspect internal bleeding .
[patient] is that why they want me to have another upper endoscopy ?
[doctor] actually it would be an upper endoscopy and a colonoscopy , but yes , likely that's the reason why .
[patient] lovely .
[doctor] yeah . unfortunately our cameras do not meet all the way in the middle , so if those tests back , come , if those tests come back fine , then we'll have you swallow a pill camera to take pictures as it moves through your , uh , system .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] we may not need to , but it's just the first thing we can do to make sure that you're not losing blood . um , the second thing we can do is have you see a hematologist . they will tell us if you need to give any , to give you any intravenous iron , or maybe something to help your body store the iron better .
[patient] all right .
[doctor] so let's go ahead , get your upper endoscopy and colonoscopy scheduled .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] um , have you ever had any issue with sedation in the past ?
[patient] no , i was just sleepy afterwards .
[doctor] okay . well we will give you a bowel prep to clean out your bowels ahead of time . um , if we do these tests and they are normal , like i said , then we will consider that capsule endoscopy .
[patient] okay . sounds like a plan .
[doctor] all right . so after that you'll be all done and we will send you to the hematologist . additionally , i'm going to need you to start taking your iron pills with orange juice . uh , the vitamin c will help you absorb the iron better . do this for about 8-12 weeks , uh , and then we can reassess your blood work .
[patient] okay , that sounds great .
[doctor] all right . well i think we have our plan . on your way out , stop by and schedule your upper endoscopy and c- colonoscopy . uh , we will send a referral to dr. flores who is is the hematologist , so schedule that appointment . um , here are your instructions for the pre- uh , the bowel prep . uh , call us if you have any questions or worsening symptoms . we'll be happy to help you .
[patient] thank you .
[doctor] you're welcome . have a great day , have a great day ms. cooper .
[patient] you too .
[doctor] all right . this is christina cooper , pleasant 65 year old female who was diagnosed with iron deficiency anemia in 12-2019 , and w- and was unable to donate blood . um , her followup blood work on 01/20/20 was revealed a low hemoglobin , stable hematocrit and normal iron labs , although ferritin was low . um , she was taking ferrous sulfate , three hundred , twenty phil- 25 milligrams by mouth . i've asked her to continue each dose with vitamin c found in orange juice , for the next 12 weeks , then recheck to the cbc , iron , ferritin , b12 , and folate . um , a referral was sent to her hematologist . we will plan for an egd and a colonoscopy to assess for potential sources of anemia or gi bleed . if this is inconclusive , capsule endoscopy will be considered . thanks .",2609.5,"Ferrous Sulfate 25 mg tablet twice per day (1 in the morning, 1 in the evening), Vitamin B12 OTC.",gpt3.5_result,The patient is currently taking iron pills (ferrous sulfate) and over-the-counter vitamin B12.,0.6,Bin 1

Chief Complaint: tick bite
Secondary Complaints: hypertension;type 2 diabetes

---------------------------------------------
MEDICAL NOTE:

CHIEF COMPLAINT

Tick bite.

MEDICAL HISTORY

Patient reports a history of arthritis, hypertension, and diabetes type 2.

SOCIAL HISTORY

Patient reports he enjoys spending time outside in the woods and working in the yard. He went hunting with his grandchildren a couple of weeks ago.

MEDICATIONS

Patient reports taking lisinopril 20 mg once a day and metformin 1000 mg twice daily most of the time.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Constitutional: Reports general ill feelings. Denies any fever, chills, flu like symptoms, body aches, or trouble waking.
Respiratory: Denies cough or shortness of breath.
Musculoskeletal: Denies joint pain or problems with ambulation.
Skin: Reports warmth on the right knee.
Neurological: Reports headache. Denies dizziness.

VITALS

Blood Pressure: 122/70 mmHg.
Heart Rate: 67 beats per minute.
Body Temperature: 98.4 degrees F.

PHYSICAL EXAM

Neck
- General Examination: Neck is supple without thyromegaly or lymphadenopathy.

Respiratory
- Auscultation of Lungs: Clear bilaterally.

Cardiovascular
- Auscultation of Heart: Regular rate and rhythm. No murmurs, gallops or rubs.

Musculoskeletal
- Examination of the right knee: Erythema and edema as well as an area of fluctuance noted over the right patella. There is pain to palpation of the right anterior knee. Full range of motion.

Integumentary
- Examination: There is evidence of a bull’s eye rash over the right knee.

RESULTS

Patient's previous kidney function is within normal limits.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

1. Tick bite.
- Medical Reasoning: My concern is that he might have Lyme disease based on the presentation of his right knee.
- Patient Education and Counseling: The patient and I discussed blood testing to determine if he does in fact have Lyme disease. I explained that Lyme disease can cause problems with other organs if not treated appropriately. We discussed that sometimes antibiotics need to be administered intravenously if oral antibiotics are not given early enough. We will see how he does with a course of oral antibiotics as I would like to avoid intravenous antibiotics.
- Medical Treatment: Prescription for doxycycline 100 mg twice a day for 3 weeks provided. Lyme titer and Western blot will be obtained to determine if he has Lyme disease.

2. Hypertension.
- Medical Reasoning: This is well-controlled at this time.
- Patient Education and Counseling: The patient and I discussed that he is doing really well monitoring his blood pressure at home.
- Medical Treatment: Continue lisinopril 20 mg once a day. Lipid panel ordered to assess his cholesterol levels.

3. Diabetes type 2.
- Medical Reasoning: He is doing a good job managing his diabetes since his blood sugars are running in the 120s. I do not think we need to make any adjustments, but we will see what the hemoglobin A1c shows as that gives us an idea of what his blood sugars are doing on a long-term basis.
- Patient Education and Counseling: We discussed that metformin can affect kidney function; however, his kidney function was last checked 2 months ago, and it has remained within normal limits.
- Medical Treatment: Continue metformin 1000 mg twice a day. Hemoglobin A1c ordered. Basic metabolic panel ordered to assess kidney function. 

Patient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.

[patient] it's a little bit sore
[doctor] okay there is pain to palpation of the right anterior knee and i'm just gon na bend your knee up and down does that hurt at all
[patient] no no it's just more of the typical grinding that i would feel
[doctor] okay there is full range of motion of the right knee and on skin examination there is evidence of a bull's-eye rash over the right knee okay so what does that mean richard so that means that you know you do have some area of some inflammation over the over the right knee where you where you have that tick bite and you do have what we call that bull's eye rash which is what we get concerned about with with lyme disease so let's just talk a little bit about you know my assessment and my plan for you okay so for this first problem of your of your tick bite my concern is that you might have lyme disease based on the presentation of your right knee so i'm gon na go ahead and start you on doxycycline one hundred milligrams twice a day
[patient] we're gon na continue that for about three weeks i'm also gon na go ahead and send a lyme titer as well as a western blot to see if you do in fact have lyme lyme disease and we'll have to go ahead and just see how you do with this we you know i'd like to avoid intravenous antibiotics which i think we can avoid but i wanted to see how you do so
[doctor] do you have any questions about that
[patient] yeah i did n't know what those last two things or just
[doctor] yeah so so we are gon na start you on some antibiotics to help help you with this
[patient] you know possible lyme disease and i'm gon na just order some blood tests just to see exactly what's going on and then you know sometimes people need intravenous antibiotics because lyme disease can cause problems on other organs like your heart that type of thing
[doctor] if not treated appropriately and sometimes we need to give antibiotics through the iv which i'd like to avoid i think that we got this early enough that we can just treat you with some oral antibiotics okay for your second problem of your hypertension you know i think you're doing a really good job let's go ahead and continue you on the lisinopril twenty milligrams once a day and i wan na just go ahead and order a lipid panel just to make sure that everything is okay with your cholesterol how does that sound

[patient] okay at what point time do you start kinda checking kidney function i've been told that metformin can possibly cause some kidney issues
[doctor] so it can you know your kidney function we've you know i think you've been really lucky it's been normal i checked it about two months ago and it looks pretty good it looks pretty normal but since we're doing blood work on you i can go ahead and order a a basic metabolic panel just to make sure that your kidney function is stable
[patient] okay that'd be good

MEDICAL NOTE:

CHIEF COMPLAINT

Right-sided abdominal pain

MEDICAL HISTORY

Patient reports history of kidney stones.

FAMILY HISTORY

Patient reports his father has a history of kidney stones.

MEDICATIONS

Patient reports use of Tylenol.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Gastrointestinal: Reports right-sided abdominal pain and nausea. Denies vomiting
Genitourinary: Reports dysuria and dark colored urine. Denies hematuria.

PHYSICAL EXAM

Gastrointestinal
- Examination of Abdomen: No masses or tenderness to palpation. No rebound or guarding. No peritoneal signs. Positive CVA tenderness on the right flank.

RESULTS

Previous CT scan of the abdomen ordered by the patient's PCP is reviewed and demonstrates a 0.5 cm kidney stone located in the proximal right ureter. There is no evidence of hydronephrosis.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

1. Acute nephrolithiasis.
- Medical Reasoning: The patient presents with complaints of right-sided abdominal pain. His previous CT scan was reviewed and demonstrates a 0.5 cm kidney stone located in the proximal right ureter without evidence of hydronephrosis.
- Medical Treatment: I have recommended that he push fluids in order to help facilitate urination to help pass the stone. He will be provided with a strainer to allow us to potentially test the stone if he is able to pass it. I have also prescribed oxycodone 5 mg every 6 to 8 hours as needed for pain. He can continue to alternate oxycodone with Tylenol. A basic metabolic panel, urinalysis, and urine culture will also be ordered.

INSTRUCTIONS

He will follow up in 1 to 2 weeks. If he is still having symptoms at that time, we will discuss further treatment such as lithotripsy or ureteroscopy. He is to contact me if he is having worsening symptoms over the next week.

---------------------------------------------","[doctor] hi russell how are you what's been going on
[patient] well i've been having this sharp pain on the right side of my abdomen below my ribs for the last several days
[doctor] i saw my doctor and they ordered a cat scan and said i had a kidney stone and sent me to see a urologist okay well does the pain move or or or go anywhere or does it stay right in that same spot yeah it feels like it goes to my lower abdomen in into my groin okay and is the pain constant or does it come and go it comes and goes when it comes it's it's pretty it's pretty bad i feel like i ca n't find a comfortable position okay and do you notice any any pain when you urinate or when you pee
[patient] yeah it kinda burns a little bit
[doctor] okay do you notice any blood i do n't think there is any you know frank blood but the urine looks a little dark sometimes okay and what have you taken for the pain i have taken some tylenol but it has n't really helped okay and do you have any nausea vomiting any fever chills i feel nauseated but i'm not vomiting okay is anyone in your in your family had kidney stones yes my father had them and have you had kidney stones before yeah so i i've i've had them but i've been able to pass them but this is taking a lot longer okay well i'm just gon na go ahead and do a physical examination i'm gon na be calling out some of my exam findings and i'm going to explain what what those mean when i'm done okay
[patient] okay
[doctor] okay so on physical examination of the abdomen on a abdominal exam there is no tenderness to palpation there is no evidence of any rebound or guarding there is no peritoneal signs there is positive cva tenderness on the right flank so essentially what that means russell is that you know you have some tenderness over your over your right kidney and that just means that you might have some inflammation there so i i reviewed the results of the ct scan of your abdomen that the primary care doctor ordered and it does show a . five centimeter kidney stone located in the proximal right ureter so this the ureter is the duct in which urine passes between the kidney and the bladder there's no evidence of what we call hydronephrosis this means you know swelling of the kidney which is good means that things are still able to get through so let's talk a little bit about my assessment and my plan okay so for your first problem of this acute nephrolithiasis or kidney stone i i wan na go ahead and recommend that you push fluids to help facilitate urination and peeing to help pass the stone i'm going to prescribe oxycodone five milligrams every six to eight hours as needed for pain you can continue to alternate that with some tylenol i'm going to give you a strainer that you can use to strain your urine so that we can see it see the stone when it passes and we can send it for some some tests if that happens i'm also gon na order what we call a basic metabolic panel a urinalysis and a urine culture now i wan na see you again in one to two weeks and if you're still having symptoms we'll have to discuss further treatment such as lithotripsy which is essentially a shock wave procedure in which we sedate you and use shock waves to break up the stone to help it pass we could also do what we call a ureteroscopy which is a small telescope small camera used to go up to to the urethra and bladder and up into the ureter to retrieve the stone so let's see how you do over the next week and i want you to contact me if you're having worsening symptoms okay okay sounds good thank you",911.0,Patient reports use of Tylenol.,gpt3.5_result,The patient is currently taking Tylenol and oxycodone.,1.0,Bin 1

Age: 34.0
Gender: female
Chief Complaint: Left knee pain
Secondary Complaints: hypertension;type 2 diabetes

---------------------------------------------
MEDICAL NOTE:

CHIEF COMPLAINT

Left knee pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Andrea Barnes is a 34-year-old female who presents today for evaluation of left knee pain.

The patient has been experiencing intermittent episodes of pain and sudden instability with ambulation. Her pain is localized deep in her patella and occurs less than once daily. Due to the fleeting nature of these episodes, she has not taken medication and simply braces herself until it passes. She denies any trauma or injury, or ever hearing or feeling a pop in the knee. Her symptoms do not interfere with her daily activities and she does not use a cane.

Regarding her hypertension, it has been several days since she last checked her blood pressure at home, but it was approximately 120/70 mmHg at that time. Her current medications include amlodipine, lisinopril, and hydrochlorothiazide, all of which she takes on a regular basis.

In terms of her diabetes, her fasting morning blood glucose levels have been approximately 130 based on home monitoring. This is slightly higher than usual, even though she has been compliant with metformin and Farxiga. She does try to avoid eating late at night.

MEDICAL HISTORY

Patient reports a personal history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes.

SOCIAL HISTORY

Patient likes to travel and is planning a trip to Columbus, Georgia in the next month or so. She is part of the Lion's Club.

MEDICATIONS

Patient reports that she is taking amlodipine, lisinopril 20 mg once daily, hydrochlorothiazide, Metformin, and Farxiga.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Musculoskeletal: Reports left knee pain and instability,

VITALS

Temperature: 98.2 degrees F
Heart rate: 72 bpm
Respirations: 16
Blood pressure: 122/70 mmHg

PHYSICAL EXAM

MSK: Examination of the right knee: No ecchymosis or edema. No effusion. No pain with palpation.
Examination of the left knee: Full range of motion. Negative varus and valgus stress test.

RESULTS

X-rays were obtained and reviewed today. These reveal no evidence of fracture or bony abnormality.

ASSESSMENT

1. Left knee pain.
2. Hypertension.
3. Diabetes mellitus type 2.

PLAN

After reviewing the patients x-rays, I believe there is some arthritis in the knee. I'm going to prescribe meloxicam 15 mg once daily. We can consider physical therapy to strengthen the muscles around the area to prevent any further issues.

Her hypertension is well controlled with her current medication regimen. She can continue with lisinopril 20 mg once daily. I'm also going to order an echocardiogram for further evaluation of the murmur heard on exam.

She has been compliant with metformin as prescribed, but her blood glucose levels have been slightly elevated recently. I'm going to order a lipid panel, as well as a hemoglobin A1c to determine if any adjustments need to be made to her dose of metformin.

---------------------------------------------","[doctor] okay hi andrea well i
[patient] hello
[doctor] i understand you're you've come in with some right knee pain can you tell me about it what's going on
[patient] it it's not the right knee it's the left knee
[doctor] okay the left knee
[patient] and it just happens occasionally less than once a day when i'm walking all of a sudden it is kind of like gives out and i think here i'm going to fall but i usually catch myself so lot of times i have to hold a grocery cart and that helps a lot so it comes and goes and it it passes just about as quickly as it comes i do n't know what it is whether i stepped wrong or i just do n't know
[doctor] okay well so where does it hurt like in on the inside or the outside or

[doctor] is that where you would be kicking your leg out or something
[patient] no it's do n't you know what line dancing is like dancing in theories of fairly fast moves but it's mostly sideways motion
[doctor] and is and that you think that's when your knee might give out then or just not gon na take the chance

MEDICAL NOTE:

CHIEF COMPLAINT

Left foot pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Jean Martinez is a pleasant 27-year-old female who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of left foot pain.

The patient sustained an injury to her left foot while playing soccer yesterday. She became entangled with another player, causing the player to fall onto the patient's foot, resulting in immediate pain. After the incident, she required help to get off of the field and was unable to participate for the rest of the game. Her trainer wrapped her foot, and she has tried ice, elevation, and ibuprofen to treat her symptoms. with medication, she rates her pain as 3/10, but without medication her pain is rated as 7-8/10. There is no numbness, tingling, or other abnormal sensations associated with her pain.

Of note, the patient has sustained several injuries in the past while playing soccer, but this is her first left foot injury.

MEDICAL HISTORY

The patient reports that she has sustained several soccer injuries in the past.

SOCIAL HISTORY

The patient has been playing soccer since she was 4 or 5 years old. She is currently playing in a local league.

MEDICATIONS

The patient reports that she has been taking ibuprofen.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Musculoskeletal: Reports left foot pain.
Neurological: Denies left foot numbness or tingling.

VITALS

Blood pressure: 118/72 mmHg
Heart rate: 58 bpm
Respiratory rate: 14
Temperature: Afebrile
Oxygen saturation: 99% on room air

PHYSICAL EXAM

CV: Regular rate and rhythm without clicks, rubs, or murmurs. No ectopic beats noted on auscultation of the heart. Brisk capillary refill, less than 3 seconds. Dorsalis pedis pulse is intact and strong.
RESPIRATORY: Lungs are clear and equal bilaterally.
NEURO: Motor and sensation in the left foot are intact to light touch.
MSK: Examination of the left foot: Ecchymosis on the plantar and dorsal aspects of the foot. Associated swelling. Tenderness to palpation of the midfoot. Positive piano key test.

RESULTS

X-ray images of the left foot were obtained and reviewed today. These reveal subtle dorsal displacement of the base of the 2nd metatarsal with a 3 mm separation of the 1st and 2nd metatarsal bases. There is presence of a bony fragment in the Lisfranc joint space.

ASSESSMENT

Lisfranc fracture, left foot.

PLAN

I explained the nature of her injury in detail. Based on her exam and x-ray findings, she will most likely require surgery of the left foot, but I want to order an MRI to assess for any ligamentous injuries. We discussed the procedure and postoperative expectations, such as recovery time and restrictions, at length. We also discussed the complications associated with deferring surgical intervention including poor bone and ligament healing, pes planus deformation, and a high likelihood of developing arthritis in the foot. She will be unable to participate for the remainder of the soccer season, but should be able to play next season.

INSTRUCTIONS

We will see the patient on Monday, for surgery.

---------------------------------------------","[doctor] hey jean how're you doing today
[patient] i'm doing alright aside from this foot pain that i have
[doctor] so i see here that you looks like you hurt your left foot here where you were playing soccer can you tell me a little bit more about what happened
[patient] yeah so yeah i was playing in a soccer game yesterday and i was trying to steal the ball from another player and she ended up falling directly onto my right foot and i do n't know i i mean i was trying to get around her and my body ended up twisting around her and then i accidentally felt a pain in my foot
[doctor] okay so have you ever hurt your left foot before
[patient] no i've had a lot of injuries in soccer but never injured this foot
[doctor] okay and then so after the fall and the entanglement with the other player were you able to continue playing
[patient] no i had to stop playing right away and actually being helped off the field
[doctor] wow okay and what have you been doing for the the pain since then
[patient] so i've been keeping it elevated icing it the trainer wrapped it yesterday and taking ibuprofen as well
[doctor] okay alright so without any ibuprofen can you tell me what your pain level is
[patient] without ibuprofen i would say my pain is a three
[doctor] okay and then with your ibuprofen can you tell me what your pain level is
[patient] like a seven eight
[doctor] okay so how long have you been playing soccer
[patient] really since i was like four five i've been playing a long time
[doctor] well that's cool yeah we our our youngest daughter she is almost sixteen and she plays the inner marrial soccer league they are down at the rex center did is that where you started playing or did you guys did you start playing somewhere else
[patient] yeah just like this local town leak i started playing that way and then played all throughout school
[doctor] that's
[patient] high school teams
[doctor] that's awesome so just out of curiosity with the left foot have you experienced anything like numbness or tingling or or any strange sensation
[patient] no i have not
[doctor] okay now if it's okay with you i would like to do a quick physical exam i reviewed your vitals and everything looks good blood pressure was one eighteen over seventy two heart rate was fifty eight respiratory rate was fourteen you are afebrile and you had an o2 saturation of ninety nine percent on room air on your heart exam your regular of rate and rhythm do n't appreciate any clicks rubs or murmurs no ectopic beats noted there on auscultation listening to your lungs lungs are clear and equal bilaterally so you're moving good air i'd like to do a focused foot exam on your left foot so i do see some bruising on the bottom of your foot and on the top of your foot as well now there is associated swelling and i do appreciate tenderness to palpation of your midfoot and you are positive for the piano key test on a neurovascular exam of your left foot you have a brisk capillary refill of less than three seconds dorsalis pedis pulse is intact and strong and you do have motor and sensation that it's intact to light touch now i would like to do a review of the diagnostic imaging that you had before you came in so i do notice a subtle dorsal displacement of the base of the second metatarsal with a three millimeter separation of the first and second metatarsal bases and the presence of a bony fragment in the lisfranc joint space so lem me talk to you a little bit about my assessment and plan now for for the first concern of right foot pain your right foot pain is due to a lisfranc fracture which is a fracture to one of your second metatarsal bones at the top of your foot where the metatarsals meet your cuboids now there are ligaments at the top of your foot so i'm gon na be ordering an mri to assess for injury to any of these ligaments now based on your exam and from what i'm seeing on your x-ray you're most likely going to need surgery of that foot now the surgery will place the bones back in their proper position and using plates and screws will hold them there while they heal and this is gon na allow those bones and ligaments to heal properly it is a day surgery and you will be able to go home the same day and then i'm going to have you follow up with me here in the clinic you'll be in a cast and you will need to use crutches and you will not be able to use that left foot for about six to eight weeks now after that six to eight weeks you will gradually start walking on your foot based on how you tolerate it and we'll see how you do at that point so i do believe you're gon na need surgery i i'm recommending this because there are significant complications to your foot if we do not do this poor bone and ligament healing can lead to losing the arch of your foot and you're becoming flat-footed you also have a high likelihood of developing arthritis in that foot so what i'm gon na do unfortunately you'll be out the rest of the season but we are gon na get you fixed up and ready for next season if you're okay with all of this i'm gon na have the nurse come in and get you started on your paperwork and then i will see you on monday morning and we will get your foot taken care of

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Dylan Bennett is a pleasant 53-year-old male who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of bilateral elbow pain, right worse than left.

The patient has been experiencing bilateral elbow pain, right worse than left, for approximately 1.5 years. His pain is localized to the medial aspect of his elbows and is described as being extremely sore, worse with increased use of his upper extremities. Of note, he utilizes heavy weights for strength training and was very active in sports when he was younger, primarily playing basketball, baseball, and football, but he denies having any pain at that time. Applying ice to the area has not been helpful, but he does use ibuprofen 800 mg 3 times daily.

SOCIAL HISTORY

The patient reports that utilizes heavy weights for strength training. He was also very active in sports when he was younger, primarily playing basketball, baseball, and football.

He is expecting a newborn baby in the near future.

MEDICATIONS

The patient reports that he has been taking ibuprofen 800 mg 3 times daily.

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, we had a lengthy discussion in regards to his current symptoms. I want to get an MRI of the bilateral elbows for further evaluation. We discussed the possibility of performing a whole blood transfusion to encourage healing, and the patient is already familiar with this procedure.

[patient] ibuprofen eight hundred milligrams three times a day
[doctor] okay and does anything make it better or worse
[patient] the more i use my hands or my arms the more it hurts
[doctor] okay have you tried icing
[patient] yes
[doctor] does that give you any relief
[patient] no
[doctor] alright is it the inside or outside of your elbows
[patient] inside
[doctor] inside okay let's just do a quick physical exam here i'll take a look at your right elbow first
[patient] mm-hmm
[doctor] if i bend it this way up does it hurt it's your left does that hurt
[patient] yes
[doctor] how about this
[patient] yes
[doctor] okay so pain with both flexion and extension
[patient] mm-hmm
[doctor] looks like you have little bit of limited range of motion on extension not on flexion though you said it hurts right here on the inside of your elbow
[patient] yes
[doctor] okay so pain on the medial side with palpation
[patient] yes
[doctor] alright how about the outside
[patient] no
[doctor] no pain with palpation outside of the elbow you have do you have normal sensation in your fingers
[patient] i think so
[doctor] yeah
[patient] yeah
[doctor] okay great
[patient] good to go
[doctor] sensation is normal to the touch
[patient] yes
[doctor] pulses equal in all extremities how about the left elbow same thing if i bend it this way does that hurt
[patient] not as much
[doctor] how about this way
[patient] not as much
[doctor] alright so little bit of pain on flexion and extension little bit of limited range of motion on extension of the arm how about if you twist like you're opening a door
[patient] yes
[doctor] okay so some pain with torsion and twisting supination what about pronation
[patient] no
[doctor] no pain with pronation on the right side
[patient] mm-hmm
[doctor] same thing on the left
[patient] yes
[doctor] pain with supination no pain with pronation
[patient] correct
[doctor] alright so dylan it took some x-rays coming in looks like you do n't have any any fractures or any bony misalignment which i expect with this kind of injury i do think that what you have is medial epicondylitis which is
[patient] is that golfer's elbow
[doctor] yes same thing have you been golfing a lot
[patient] well not in the past year and a half i've had this for a long time
[doctor] okay also known as pictures elbow
[patient] well i have n't been pitching either
[doctor] hmmm well in any case what i'm gon na have to do is i'm gon na send you up for mri to take another look at this
[patient] mm-hmm
[doctor] that will be our next step so we'll get you scheduled for the mri probably get you in pretty quick here since we're a private practice
[patient] thank god
[doctor] yeah and once you get the mri i'll know a little bit more what i'd like to do is something called a whole blood transfusion have you heard of that before
[patient] no please tell me remind me
[doctor] yeah it should help with the healing of your elbow it's just a procedure we'll stick a needle in your elbow
[patient] you do a stick needle in my elbow
[doctor] mm-hmm and help with some of the healing of your elbow
[patient] so it's kinda like dry needling then
[doctor] no
[patient] not at all
[doctor] what is it
[patient] is it is that that thing where like you take the blood out of like say my my thigh
[doctor] mm-hmm
[patient] and then you literally inject it into my tendon
[doctor] yes
[patient] that it activates the healing
[doctor] yeah that's exactly what it is
[patient] interesting cool
[doctor] yeah
[patient] maybe i have heard about that
[doctor] we've we've had some really good responses from other patients on it so hopefully i mean that should be a good solution for you since you've been having issues with this
[patient] i'm excited
[doctor] yeah and we can hopefully get you scheduled for that in the next couple of weeks it's not not a major procedure and you should heal in the next two weeks so that wo n't be a problem especially considering that you're expecting a newborn soon we want to make sure you're all healed for that
[patient] wow i did n't even say that
[doctor] i read it in your chart
[patient] man you doctors are good
[doctor] yeah anything else going on today

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

1. Congestive heart failure.
- Medical Reasoning: This appears to have been caused by dietary indiscretion and uncontrolled hypertension.
- Patient Education and Counseling: I encouraged the patient to continue making dietary modifications, including limiting her sodium intake. She could try keeping a food diary, as previously discussed, to log her diet and associated blood pressure readings. I also advised her to monitor her weight daily and contact me if she gains 3 pounds in 2 days.
- Medical Treatment: Continue with Bumex 2 mg once daily. Referral placed for consult with a nutritionist for education and recommendations regarding her diet.

2. Hypertension.
- Medical Reasoning: This has been poorly controlled due to inconsistent compliance with medication and dietary indiscretion.
- Patient Education and Counseling: We discussed dietary modifications as noted above.
- Medical Treatment: She can continue on Cozaar 100 mg daily and Norvasc 5 mg once daily. Renal artery ultrasound ordered to rule out any issues such as renal artery stenosis.

Gender: female 
Chief Complaint: follow-up bilateral breast cysts
Secondary Complaints: anxiety; itchiness

---------------------------------------------
MEDICAL NOTE:

CHIEF COMPLAINT

Follow-up bilateral breast cysts.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Donna Torres is a 40-year-old female who presents for follow-up surveillance of bilateral breast cysts.

The patient reports continual presence of “lumps” in bilateral breasts with some soreness. She is being seen today for surveillance of the cysts. The patient is taking progesterone, which was initially prescribed to support normalization of menstruation, which was effective. She is also still using vaginal cream one time per week which has improved symptoms of itching and discomfort.

Her last pap smear was in 2019, with negative/negative results. She did have an abnormal pap smear in 2009, which resulted in repeat pap smears per 6 months until her results normalized.

Mrs. Torres experienced increased anxiety in 11/2021 and 12/2021, stating “it was brutal” and felt she could not manage her symptoms and sought treatment. Dr. Brown started the patient on Buspar, which has successfully controlled her anxiety. The patient relates her anxiety to work related stress and possibly aging. Her work involves supporting Covid evaluation centers and clinics. She confirms receiving both Covid vaccinations. Initially, she was experiencing spikes in anxiety prior to menstruation, but her anxiety then became more random with an unclear cause. To note, the patient was started on Singulair, which the patient was told could also cause anxiety.

The patient discontinued Camila birth control, which did result in a significant increase in appetite. This has resolved and she reports she has lost weight in the past 6 months.

---------------------------------------------","[doctor] donna torres , date of birth , 08/01/1980 .
[doctor] hi donna ! how are you ?
[patient] i'm good . how about you ?
[doctor] i'm doing well , thank you . and so , i saw that dr. brown put you on buspar . have you been on that before ?
[patient] no , that's new .
[doctor] okay . how is it working for you ?
[patient] my anxiety is going good now , thankfully . i'm serious , it was brutal in november and december . finally , i was like , "" i can not do this . "" i have no idea why it happened . dr. ward did put me on singulair , and she did say we need to be careful because singulair can cause anxiety . so i'm not sure if that was the issue or what .
[doctor] mm . okay .
[patient] and it would , um , start usually during the day , at work .
[doctor] i see .
[patient] i mean , i'm fine now .
[doctor] well , that's good , that things have settled . i do wonder if some of what you are dealing with is hormonal , and that's why i was asking . 'cause you were on the progesterone , and i feel like you were having some irritability back then too .
[patient] i did .
[doctor] and that was before we started the progesterone .
[patient] yes .
[doctor] so i know we started it for regulating your periods , but perhaps it helped with this also .
[patient] yeah . and before , in november and december , i noticed that the week before my period , my anxiety would go through the roof . which then , i knew my period was coming . then it turned into my anxiety spiking just at random times .
[doctor] hmm , okay .
[patient] and it seemed like it was for no reason .
[doctor] but november and december you were on the progesterone at that time .
[patient] yes .
[doctor] all right . so not really a link there , all right .
[patient] yeah , i do n't know .
[doctor] yeah , i do n't know either . um , sometimes with the aging process , that can happen too .
[patient] i figured maybe that's what it was .
[doctor] and we did go through the golive in november and december , so that can be pretty stressful also .
[patient] yeah , and at work , that's when i first started to lead the process of delivering the results to patients with covid . in the beginning of the whole pandemic , patients would have to wait nine days before they'd get their results . and then we opened the evaluation centers and the covid clinic . so i think it just took a toll on me .
[doctor] yeah , i can absolutely see that .
[patient] yeah , and then i was feeling selfish because i was n't even on the front lines . i mean , i was supporting people , sure , but i was n't in the icu . so i felt selfish and guilty . i mean , hands down , the physicians and nurses were in the thick of it and there i was , having anxiety . and it felt ridiculous .
[doctor] well , honestly , you feel how you feel and what you were doing was n't easy as well , so ... but let's see . i need to just put this dax back to work . all right , so no other issues whatsoever ?
[patient] no .
[doctor] have you lost weight ?
[patient] no , but i stopped taking the camila birth control . my hunger level was at a new high . i mean , i was eating constantly . i felt like , "" what is going on ? ""
[doctor] all right .
[patient] and now i am feeling better .
[doctor] okay , that's good . and your masked face , though , it does look thinner .
[patient] well , the past six months i have lost some weight .
[doctor] okay , good . um , anything else going on ?
[patient] no .
[doctor] all right . so your pap was in 2019 . i do n't think that we need to repeat that because it was negative/negative . um , have you ever had an abnormal pap ?
[patient] not with you , but i did around 2009 , and then i had to be seen every six months for a while . and then i had a normal pap .
[doctor] all right , well , let's just repeat it then .
[patient] yeah , that's fine with me , to be safe .
[doctor] okay . i know it sounds superstitious , but i feel like with all the immunocompromising , the pressure , the stress that people's bodies have been under , and the potential for getting covid or the vaccine ... i have actually seen some , um , an increase in abnormal paps in people who have been fine for a while . so that's why i figure let's just check .
[patient] okay . i fight the vaccine fight every day at home because my husband is n't ready to get it . same with my daughter . she shares the same worries as her dad in how it'll impact her when she gets older .
[doctor] have you had the vaccine ?
[patient] yes , i have . and so has my son . he , um , has had his first already .
[doctor] okay . well , you know , you can only do what you can do .
[patient] yeah , i agree .
[doctor] all right . well , let's complete your exam .
[patient] all right .
[doctor] so let's take a deep breath . and again . all right , you can breathe normally . all right , and take one more deep breath . okay , now i'm gon na touch your neck . go ahead and swallow . perfect . and just place your hand above your head . okay , i do feel some little bumps .
[patient] yeah , but they're not as big as they were .
[doctor] mm-hmm . okay , in this breast it does feel a little bit denser . does it hurt at all ?
[patient] it does , where your left hand just was .
[doctor] okay , right here ?
[patient] yeah , down here . but whenever i breastfed , it was always sore there too . i had a clog and something else . the lumps do feel smaller , but they are still there , unfortunately .
[doctor] yeah , they are . uh , well now i do n't know , because if it was the progesterone , they would've gone away .
[patient] yeah .
[doctor] all right , well just let your knees just op- relax and open . how's the itching or discomfort ? are you still using the cream ?
[patient] yes , and i actually need to get that refilled for the first time ever .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] uh , but yeah , i use it once a week and it does help .
[doctor] okay , great . all right , looks good .
[patient] good .
[doctor] you can go ahead and sit up .
[patient] thank you .
[doctor] all right , so typically the lumps would often just shrink up pretty quickly after you've had one or two cycles , and you've had two cycles so far . so i think let's just keep monitoring them for now .
[patient] okay . and what could that mean ?
[doctor] well , so just like people have an increased risk of breast cancer , there's also an increased risk for breast issues . you know what i mean ? so for example , cysts and lumps and fibroadenomas , those are all benign things . they're annoying and require some workup , but they're all benign .
[patient] and i'm- i'm just worried because i'm almost 40 and my mom was almost 45 when she was diagnosed with breast cancer . so i mean , i know there's nothing i can do about it , but it's just i feel like , uh , we had it under control and now it is n't .
[doctor] well , i would n't say that . i mean , i feel like we're at a point where we have a good cadence for you having surveillance on things , and i think you are more aware of your breasts than ever before , and things actually have n't changed .
[patient] yeah .
[doctor] so those are all good things .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] because , um , if it was cancer , we'd actually , we would see some change .
[patient] we would ? okay , thank you for explaining that .
[doctor] yeah . so i know it's annoying and distressing , but i think that's where we're at . it's annoying that you have the breast issue , and it's annoying that we have to follow them .
[patient] yeah , i agree there .
[doctor] um , but the only extra that i could po- , uh , potentially do , is we could get a breast specialist on the team and have you start to follow with them . and one of the advantages there is that they sometimes will do an ultrasound as an extension of their physical exam , in the office , to check out it- check it out on their own . uh , they also have a lot more experience and more willingness to sometimes perform procedures earlier , if they think it needs , um , if they think it needs to be done . and i think they tend to be much quicker than , you know , like radiology as to biopsy it .
[patient] okay . i'll do whatever you think i should .
[doctor] all right . well , i think since you're feeling worried , let's go ahead and we can get them on board . i'll send out a referral and they will call you within the next couple of business days to schedule .
[patient] okay , i think that sounds great .
[doctor] all right . i do too . all right , well any questions or anything else we can discuss today ?
[patient] no , i think i'm all set .
[doctor] all right , good . all right , well have a good rest of your day and just give us a call if you need anything else .
[patient] all right , thank you . you have a good day too .

SURGICAL HISTORY

Patient reports history of tonsillectomy.

SOCIAL HISTORY

Patient reports she is a student and enjoys playing water polo as well as being active with aerobics and running.

ALLERGIES

Patient reports history of seasonal allergies.

MEDICATIONS

Patient reports using an albuterol inhaler, 2 puffs as needed.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Constitutional: Reports fatigue.
Respiratory: Reports shortness of breath.
Psychiatric: Reports mood changes.

PHYSICAL EXAM

Ears, Nose, Mouth, and Throat
- Examination of Ears: Mild fluid in ears.

Gastrointestinal
- Auscultation: Bowel sounds normal in all 4 quadrants.

Integumentary
- Examination: No rash or lesions. Normal capillary refill and perfusion.
- Palpation: No enlarged lymph nodes.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

1. Asthma.
- Medical Reasoning: The patient has experienced an increased need to use her albuterol inhaler. She is not currently utilizing a daily medication. At this time, we will try a daily medication since it looks like she might be having some allergies.
- Patient Education and Counseling: I explained the side effects of albuterol to the patient. We also discussed Singulair and that she should start to see a difference in her breathing within approximately 1 month.
- Medical Treatment: We will start her on a daily asthma medication. She can continue to use the albuterol inhaler. We will start her on Singulair in about a month.

2. Mood.
- Medical Reasoning: The patient reports being under a lot of stress with school. I believe this may be attributing to her mood.
- Medical Treatment: I would like for the patient to be seen by a therapist. She will also complete our screening questionnaire.

Patient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.

INSTRUCTIONS

The patient will follow up in 6 weeks for recheck.

---------------------------------------------","[doctor] okay
[patient] good morning
[doctor] good morning thanks doctor doctor cooper i'm i'm you know i'm a little i'm sad to be in here but you know thanks for taking me in i appreciate it
[patient] sure absolutely what can i help you with today
[doctor] so you know i've been dealing with my asthma and like i tried to join sports but it's really kind of it's getting hard you know and i i i just wonder if there's something that can be done because i really do like playing water polo
[patient] but i'm having difficulty breathing sometimes i've had to like you know stop matches and sit on the side just to kind of like catch my breath and use my inhaler so i was wondering if there was something we could do about it
[doctor] and then like i'm kind of a little bit worried i think my mood is getting a little a little worrisome and i i wanted to explore like what my options were
[patient] okay let's talk about the asthma first so what inhaler are you using now
[doctor] i have an albuterol inhaler
[patient] okay and when when you're having trouble it's usually just around sports that is it keeping you up at night
[doctor] so i do n't really like wake up at night a lot typically like it's sports like you know if i'm doing anything like crazy aerobic or like running or anything i do notice that if any if i'm around smoke i do start coughing a little bit but most of the time it's sports
[patient] okay and can you describe a little bit for me what happens
[doctor] i start to yeah no so i start to feel like there is like some phlegm building up in my in my throat and i start coughing like my chest gets tight i start wheezing and i just have to sit down or else i'm gon na get like lightheaded too
[patient] okay and then when you use your inhaler
[doctor] mm-hmm
[patient] does it does it alleviate the problem
[doctor] so yeah it helps with that like phlegm feeling you know but i still i still have to sit down you know and like breathe and then the thing that i hate about that inhaler is i start getting like shaky is that supposed to be happening
[patient] yes that is unfortunately normal and a side effect with the inhaler
[doctor] okay
[patient] so you use you're using two puffs of the inhaler
[doctor] mm-hmm
[patient] for the symptoms
[doctor] yes
[patient] and then you sit down and does it does it get better within about fifteen minutes or so
[doctor] yeah yeah it does but you know i had to like step out of the the pool to make that happen i'm hoping that there is something else we can do okay have you ever taken any daily medications for your asthma an inhaler or singulair or anything like that no i i just use my inhaler whenever i have an attack
[patient] okay so that's something we might wan na consider but how often is it happening
[doctor] pretty much every time i do any kind of aerobic workout
[patient] okay and outside of physical activity you're not having any problems
[doctor] yeah there's that part where like if i'm around somebody who has been smoking a lot or is currently smoking but i usually just step away i do n't even like to be around them you know that makes sense
[patient] alright well we will look at that tell me about the mood issues you are having
[doctor] yeah so one of the reasons i got into like trying to get into sports is like i feel like you know you you feel a lot more energized and a lot you know happier but like lately i've just been kinda stressed out you know like i have i have like sats that i need to study for i've got like all these ap classes you know there's just it i feel like there's a lot of pressure and you know like i get it but there are times where i'm just like really down and i i do n't really know what else i can do
[patient] okay that makes sense any any difficulty with focusing or you're having difficulty retaining information or is it more feeling sad not having motivation
[doctor] so i think it's like a lot of sadness a lot of like you know i do n't really i kinda feel like you know i do n't really like want to do anything you know my friends will go out and i'll just be like i'd rather be at home i am really tired a lot too
[patient] okay alright well let me let me go ahead and check you out
[doctor] mm-hmm
[patient] and then we can talk a little bit more
[doctor] okay
[patient] i'm gon na take a listen to your heart and lungs
[doctor] mm-hmm
[patient] and everything sounds good
[doctor] let me take a look at your eyes
[patient] mm-hmm and in your ears everything looks okay have you had any problems with allergies you have seasonal allergies or anything like that
[doctor] yeah i think so yeah
[patient] i do see just a little bit of fluid in the ears
[doctor] mm-hmm
[patient] and i'm gon na look in your mouth too
[doctor] okay
[patient] and throat looks fine no tonsils
[doctor] mm-hmm
[patient] lem me go ahead and have you lay back on the table and i'll take a listen to your stomach
[doctor] okay
[patient] everything sounds okay i'm gon na feel around just to make sure everything feels normal
[doctor] mm-hmm
[patient] everything feels fine and i'm gon na check reflexes and they're all normal
[doctor] awesome
[patient] it's really hard to do with actual patient so in terms of the asthma i think we could try a daily medication since it looks like you might be having a little bit of allergies maybe we can try some singulair
[doctor] mm-hmm
[patient] and start with that once you are on that daily and you can continue to use the albuterol inhaler those side effects unfortunately you're right it's it's just one of the expected side effects with an albuterol inhaler i would recommend just what you're doing just sit down for a little bit after you take it
[doctor] and we will get you started on the singulair probably within about a month you should see a difference so i will have you come back in about six weeks and follow up and see how you're doing with that
[patient] in terms of the mood is this new for you
[doctor] yeah i think so like when i started this year
[patient] and it sounds like related to school expectations and the stress with saps and all of that
[doctor] yeah
[patient] okay let's consider having you start seeing a therapist i think that would be a good place to start
[doctor] mm-hmm
[patient] and we will do some screening questionnaires and and then follow up in a couple weeks on that too
[doctor] okay alright sounds like a plan okay
[patient] thank you",823.2666666666667,"Patient reports using an albuterol inhaler, 2 puffs as needed.",gpt3.5_result,The patient is currently taking an albuterol inhaler for their asthma.,0.6666666666666666,Bin 1

Gender: female 
Chief Complaint: hypothyroidism 
Secondary Complaints: weight loss; acne

MEDICAL NOTE:

CHIEF COMPLAINT

Hypothyroidism.
Abnormal liver enzymes.
Abnormal weight gain.
Acne vulgaris.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Christine Hernandez is a 39-year-old female who presents today for evaluation and management of abnormal liver enzymes and hypothyroidism.

When the patient was last seen, her thyroid medicine was changed to Unithroid, but due to the cost of $75, she has not yet started the new medicine and continues taking her previous thyroid medicine. She denies utilizing the coupon that was previously recommended for the Unithroid. Similarly, the patient was prescribed Epiduo for her acne vulgaris, which she did not fill due to the cost of $100. She tried filling both prescriptions at Walmart.

Mrs. Hernandez still presents with abnormal weight gain. She questioned if her oral contraceptive Microgestin, which was discontinued, could have been the cause. Additional symptoms included acne, hirsutism. She is attempting to modify her intake and plans to resume her gym membership in July as she will be on vacation. She inquired about the impact on weight loss of chromium, CLA, and amino acids.

The patient confirmed that she is taking her high dose Vitamin D as prescribed. She does suffer from constipation and she treats with MiraLAX.

She denies previous treatment for her acne vulgaris. She denies ever using clindamycin topical antibiotic. She reports having sensitive skin, developing rashes with various skin products.

PAST HISTORY

Medical
Hypothyroidism.
Acne Vulgaris.
Vitamin D deficiency.
Abnormal weight gain.
Hirsutism.
Constipation.

CURRENT MEDICATIONS

Benzoyl Peroxide.
Clindamycin Gel applied topically.
Vitamin D 2000 IU daily.
Unithroid.
MiraLAX.

ALLERGIES

No known allergies.

RESULTS

Dexamethasone Suppression Test: Normal.

Salivary Cortisol Tests: 2 out of 3 were normal. Not consistent with Cushing’s Syndrome.

Hepatic Function Panel: ALT 128.
Lipid Panel: Total cholesterol 222 mg/dL, HDL 44 mg/dL, LDL 153 mg/dL, non-HDL 178 mg/dL.

FAI: Normal.

ASSESSMENT

• Hypothyroidism.
• Abnormal liver enzymes.
• Abnormal weight gain.
• Acne vulgaris
• Vitamin D deficiency.
• Hirsutism

PLAN

Hypothyroidism
The patient will again attempt to initiate Unithroid. I have printed out the prescription and a discount card, which should result in a reduced price. She will contact my office if she encounters additional issues.

Abnormal liver enzymes
We have seen improvement since the discontinuation of Microgestin. I recommended the spermicide Phexxi for alternative birth control. The patient will also continue working on weight loss, which should additionally improve her liver enzymes.

Abnormal weight gain
Cushing’s Syndrome has been ruled out. I reviewed the weight loss study with the patient, she will call within a month if she is interested in participating. I advised her to follow a low carbohydrate, low cholesterol, abstain from alcohol, and reduce fatty foods diet.

Acne vulgaris
Epiduo was not covered and too expensive. The patient will try benzoyl peroxide and Clindamycin separately to see if the price improves.

Vitamin D deficiency
The patient will complete the high dose vitamin D and then should start vitamin D 2000 IU per day to maintain her levels.

Hirsutism
Her androgen levels were normal.

INSTRUCTIONS

She will repeat all labs prior to her next visit.","[doctor] next patient is christine hernandez , uh , date of birth is january 13th , 1982 .
[doctor] hey , miss christine , how are you doing today ?
[patient] i'm good , thanks . how are you ?
[doctor] i'm pretty good . so it looks like you've completed the covid vaccine , that's great .
[patient] yes , i did .
[doctor] anything new since your last visit ?
[patient] no , i did all the tests that you had recommended me to take . i have n't been able to take the thyroid medicine , the one that you prescribed , as i'm still taking my old one . um , the price was a little high on the new one .
[doctor] okay , so did ... did you try the coupon that i gave you ?
[patient] i did not try the coupon , uh , there was a charge of $ 75 .
[doctor] okay , well , next time that ... that coupon should help , and it should only be about $ 3 .
[patient] okay , um ... i do n't have it , do you happen to have another one you can give me ?
[doctor] yep , right here .
[patient] wonderful , thank you so much , and ... and then the gel , they are charging me $ 100 for it . so , i do n't know if this is because it's a ... it's wal-mart , or if i should try somewhere else , or ... maybe you know how or where i can get it cheaper .
[doctor] yeah , let's try something else , um ... sometimes it can be cheaper if we just prescribe you the individual ingredients of a medication , rather than the , the combined medication itself .
[patient] that would be great .
[doctor] so , that's clindamycin gel and benzoyl peroxide , uh , maybe by doing them separately , they could be a lot cheaper . so , that we can do . the unithroid , with the discount code , should only be about $ 9 for 90 days .
[patient] okay , that would be great . yeah , they were charging me $ 75 , and i just could n't pay that .
[doctor] maybe we'll try different pharmacy , as well .
[patient] okay . so , do you think that my weight gain could have been the birth control that i was taking before that caused it ?
[doctor] maybe . i do n't really see an endocrine cause for it , at least , so i would need to see the , the hyperandrogynism or high testosterone . or , a high dhea , to cause acne , or hair growth , or any of that stuff . but , the numbers are n't showing up out of range .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] i really do n't see any endocrine cause for it , like i said . your growth hormone was fine , but we definitely want to and need to treat it . um , i do n't know if we talked about maybe a little weight loss study .
[patient] you mentioned the weight loss study , and you mentioned that i have some meal plans , um , that you had given me . i still have those , too .
[doctor] have you tried to make any changes in the diet since the last time we spoke ?
[patient] i've been trying to get better . i will start back at the gym in july , because of my contract , i had to put a hold on it until then .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] so , i do want to start doing that . i will be a little freer since , um , i'll be on vacation after july 8th .
[doctor] okay , good .
[patient] and then my cousin was telling me to ask you about cla , because it's supposed to help your metabolism . is that okay to take ?
[doctor] um , i'm not sure . what is c , cla ?
[patient] i'm not sure what it is , either .
[doctor] okay , well , i'm unfamiliar with it , so ...
[patient] okay . i also have a coworker who has a thyroid issue too , and she suggested to try chromium for weight loss .
[doctor] so , that likely will not help too much . you can try either , if you really want to , but then ... it will not accept you into the weight loss study if you try those two .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] chromium is just a supplement and it wo n't help that much .
[patient] it wo n't , okay , thank you .
[doctor] it wo n't hurt ... okay , i should n't say that it wo n't hurt , but , it also wo n't help that much . so , it's up to you .
[patient] okay . and so , my cousin also suggested amino acids , and that i might find them in certain foods , i guess , for my workout .
[doctor] yeah . amino acids are fine , they wo n't , wo n't really help with weight loss either , but it might help , uh , you replenish , and just kind of , feel hydrated .
[patient] okay . are they proteins ? um , my cousin said she had lost some weight , and has been working out every day , but she does n't work , so ... i do n't know .
[doctor] yes , amino acids are what make up the protein , which is in any food you eat , with any protein . so , meats , dairy , nuts , any of that sort of thing .
[patient] okay , thank you . got it .
[doctor] all right . um , are you allergic to any medications ?
[patient] no , not that i know of .
[doctor] okay . is your s- skin pretty sensitive ?
[patient] yes .
[doctor] all right .
[patient] um , yeah , my size , i will start getting rashes , with different products .
[doctor] and have you ever tried clindamycin topical , as an antibiotic for your acne ?
[patient] no , i've never tried anything for it .
[doctor] okay . we might give you some of that .
[patient] okay . and i also want to mention that my feet do swell up a lot .
[doctor] okay . i'm ... let me take a look at that for just a moment . um , any constipation ?
[patient] yes , i also do have that problem .
[doctor] all right . mira- miralax will definitely help with that .
[patient] okay , yes , my doctor did also recommend that .
[doctor] great . all right , let's do an exam real quick . please have a seat on this table and i'll listen to your lungs and heart .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] all right , deep breath . all right , again .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] all right , sounds good .
[patient] great .
[doctor] let me take a look at your feet and ankles .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] all right , they look okay right now , certainly let your doctor know about this if it gets any worse or reoccurs .
[patient] okay , i will do that .
[doctor] now , let's go over your lab work . so , when you took that pill , the dexamethasone test , you passed , which means you do n't have cushing's syndrome . on that test , at least . the salivary cortisol , though , unless you did one wrong ... two of them were completely normal and one was abnormal , so , we might need to repeat that in the future .
[patient] okay , that's okay .
[doctor] all right , so , your cholesterol was quite high . the total cholesterol was 222 . the good cholesterol was about 44 . the bad was 153 , and it should be less than 100 . the non-hdl was about 178 , and it should be less than 130 . the good cholesterol should be over 50 , and it was 44 . so , your screen for diabetes is ... was fine . you do have a vitamin d deficiency , and , i do n't know if we started the vitamin d yet , or not .
[patient] yes , we did . i- i do need to take one today , though .
[doctor] okay . so , i also checked a lot of other pituitary hormones , iron levels ... everything else seemed to be pretty good , and in decent range .
[patient] okay , that sounds great . so , i wanted to also show you my liver enzymes , um , because i have n't come back since then ... but i was also happy , because one of them was back to normal .
[doctor] okay , great . let's see them .
[patient] okay . so , the one that's 30 , that was almost 200 not so long ago .
[doctor] yeah , your alt was about 128 .
[patient] okay , and , and back in october was 254 .
[doctor] yeah , this is much better .
[patient] okay , great . and then it dropped in january , and then it dropped a little more in march , since i stopped taking the medicine in december .
[doctor] okay , that's good . so ... i'm proud of you with the course of your labs , so before i forget , i'm going to , uh , just put your labs into the computer today , and i wo n't be checking your vitamin d level for some time .
[patient] okay . so , with the thyroid , and the low vitamin d , does that always happen together ?
[doctor] um , i do have a lot of people that have thyroid , thyroid issues and they have vitamin d deficiency .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] this is what i'm , um , i'm going to do . i'm going to put , print out your prescriptions , so you can shop around at the pharmacies and see if you can find better prices .
[patient] okay , that way i can go ask them and try cvs .
[doctor] yeah , that sounds like a plan .
[patient] okay , good . so , the weight loss study that you mentioned , when does that start ? or , how does that work ?
[doctor] so , we are about to start , as we just got approval last week , and we are just waiting on our paperwork so we can get started .
[patient] okay , and what's involved with that ?
[doctor] so , it'll involve you receiving a medication which has been used for diabetes treatment , and it works mostly in the gut on satiety , or satiety hormones . um , the most common side effects are going to be nausea , vomiting , diarrhea and constipation . they are s- uh , six arms , to the study . one is a placebo , the other ones are a , various as ... various dosages of the medication , excuse me . um , you would receive an injection once a week . also , keep in mind that most of the weight loss medications are not covered by insurance .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] so , it's a way of getting them , but , the odds of getting one of the arms with the medication that are in your favor , right , might be only one out of five of our hundred patients that we have on the list for the study that will receive the placebo .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] does that make sense ?
[patient] yes , it does .
[doctor] so , we do expect pretty big weight loss , because of what we learn in diabetes study . so , it's a year long , uh , process , and it's an injection once a week . you come in weekly for the first four , five weeks , i believe . and then , after that , it's once a month . you do get a stipend for partici- for participating in the study , and parking is validated , and whatever else that you need for the study .
[patient] okay , do you know how much the stipend is ?
[doctor] um , i will have to double check for you , and , you do n't have to be my patient , you just have to meet the criteria . so the criteria is a bmi greater than 30 , if you do n't have any other medical condition . or , a bmi greater than 27 , if you do have another medical condition , like your cholesterol . um , a bmi greater than 27 would quali- uh , qualify you .
[patient] i have a friend who might be interested , and she does have diabetes .
[doctor] if she has d- diabetes , then she wo n't qualify .
[patient] okay , you ca n't if you ... if you have diabetes , got it .
[doctor] correct . yeah , the only thing that , um , they can not have , really , is diabetes . so , either a psychiatric disease , or schizophrenia , bipolar , things like that .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] but , if they have hypertension , high cholesterol , things like that ... they can definitely sign up .
[patient] and they can , okay . thank you for explaining that .
[doctor] of course . so , do you want me to try to get you into that study ? or , would you just like to try , me to prescribe something ? it's kind of up to you .
[patient] i think i'll just wait for a little bit now .
[doctor] all right , sounds good . i'll give you the information for the research , it's just in my office . um , it is a different phone number , though . so then , if you're interested , just call us within a month , because i do n't know how long , uh , the , the wait will be .
[patient] okay , will do .
[doctor] perfect . so , let me go grab your discount card for the unithroid . um , when you go in to activate it , the instructions are on this card , and then you use your insurance ... then , show them this , and ask how much it'll cost . if it's too expensive , just let me know .
[patient] i will . thank you so much for your help on that .
[doctor] you're welcome . then , what i did is , i gave you a topical antibiotic , plus i gave you the benzoyl peroxide . so , the peroxide may bleach your sheets , but , you want to make sure to take it and apply it at night , so you do n't have a reaction from the sun during the day .
[patient] okay , i can do that .
[doctor] but , you do also want to make sure that you do n't mess up your sheets .
[patient] okay , sounds good .
[doctor] um , so , that's that . and then , let's see how you do on the other medications . i think this will , this will get better . in the meantime , a low-carb diet , avoid alcohol and fatty foods , and low chole- cholesterol foods .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] and again , once you finish your dose of vitamin d , for the vitamin d deficiency , you're gon na start with the 2000iu daily , so that you're able to maintain those levels . sound good ?
[patient] yes , that sounds great .
[doctor] i really think your liver enzymes are going to get better once you lose the weight , though .
[patient] okay , that would be great .
[doctor] since we stopped your birth control , we can try once called phexxi , which is kind of like a spermicide , basically .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] and you just apply it before intercourse .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] if you need some , uh , just let me know .
[patient] okay , i will . i'll let you know .
[doctor] okay , perfect . so , stay put for me now . i'm going to go see if they have discount samples , and bring you that prescription . and then , i'm going to order the labs for next time .
[patient] okay , great , thank you so much .
[doctor] you're welcome .
[doctor] so , under the plan , under abnormal liver enzymes , they have improved since discontinuation of her birth control . under abnormal weight gain , her dexamethasone suppression test was normal . two out of three salivary cortisol tests were normal , not consistent with cushing's , and therefore we're ruling out cushing's . under her hirsutism , her androgen levels were normal . for the acne vulgaris , the epiduo was not covered , so we'll try benzoyl peroxide with clindamycin , and remove the previous information . on the hyperthyroidism , we'll print out her prescriptions . unithroid should be better priced with the discount card , and we'll repeat levels of everything before next visit . thanks .",3536.217391304348,"Benzoyl Peroxide.

MEDICAL NOTE:

CHIEF COMPLAINT

Hypogonadism.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Mr. Paul Edwards is a 59-year-old male, an established patient, who presents to the clinic today for hypogonadism. He was last seen on 11/24/2020. The patient’s history includes positive for HIV, and today he is concerned with gynecomastia.

The patient is doing well, overall, and feels the testosterone is helping. He reports weight stability, feels lively, good, more vigorous, and he is sleeping well. He also thinks the testosterone is having a positive effect on his blood work. He endorses that his triglycerides have always been elevated and adds that they were as high as 265 mg/dL. The patient presented a copy of his bloodwork, showing a significant decrease in his cholesterol after 5 months. Mr. Edwards questioned if the changes in his blood work were due to the testosterone. He also noted that his red blood cell count has not increased. The patient inquired about possible benefits of Indole-3-carbinol, which is a broccoli extract for estrogen control.

Currently, the patient is dosing 140 ng/dL of testosterone per week and inquired if his dose could be increased to 175 ng/dL. He recalled that he had recently injected testosterone before his last testosterone blood work was performed; last testosterone levels were greater than 1500 ng/dL. The patient confirms continued daily use of Finasteride and Cialis, prescribed by me, and stated he needs a refill for both.

Mr. Edwards mentioned he is taking correct steps to get his life ""together."" He also uses a med calendar to help with medication compliance.

PAST HISTORY

Medical
HIV

SOCIAL HISTORY

Utilizes med calendar to support medication compliance.
Actively trying to get his life together.

CURRENT MEDICATIONS

Cialis 5 mg tablet by mouth on days he exercises, 2.5 mg tablet by mouth on days without exercise.
Finasteride 5 mg half tablet daily.
Testosterone cypionate 140 mg.

RESULTS

PSA 0.6 ng/mL.
Triglycerides 145 mg/dL.
Total testosterone 1500 ng/dL, 11/24/2021.

ASSESSMENT

• Hypogonadism.

PLAN

I recommend maintaining current management. The patient’s last testosterone levels were greater than 1500 ng/dL, although this level was likely related to his recent injection. He requested an increase to his testosterone cypionate from 140 mg to 175 mg, which I denied due to his already high testosterone levels. I counseled the patient on the risks associated with high testosterone levels and Indole-3-carbinol and it’s lacking evidence to support his estrogen levels. The last time his estradiol levels were checked, they were normal; recommend annual screening.

I provided paper prescription refills for Cialis and Finasteride.","[doctor] next patient is paul edwards , date of birth is january 15th 1962 . so he's a 59 year old hiv positive gentleman here for hypogonadism . patient was last seen on november 24th 2020 . his notable things are number one , he is on 1 milliliter every 10 days , uh , his levels were less than 300 to begin with . he's on finasteride currently . he also takes cialis daily so he takes all his pills just from me . um , patient's other area of concern is gynecomastia which is ... which we will discuss with him today . his last psa was 0.66 and his last testosterone was greater than 1,500 .

[patient] and cialis , on the days i work out i take 5 milligrams otherwise i take two and a half milligram pills , but , uh , i have been out of it .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] but overall i'm doing well , i'm actually taking the correct steps to get my life together .
[doctor] good . it's always great to hear . well let's take a look . uhm , i'm gon na listen to your heart and lungs .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] please use my general exam template , all right . just take a few breaths .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] in and out .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] all right , everything sounds good , no concerns there .
[patient] great . so i wanted to show you something .
[doctor] sure .
[patient] look at this .
[doctor] okay , this is your cholesterol ?
[patient] yeah , my cholesterol and triglycerides . uh , i used to have high triglycerides , you see they were 265 milligrams per deciliter , and i took my first dose of the testosterone on the 28th .
[doctor] right .
[patient] now 5 months later look at my numbers .
[doctor] wow , that's remarkable .
[patient] is it the test ? it's the only change .
[doctor] i do n't know , i have n't honestly seen many guys over the years that have cholesterol problems and this . i mean there's a big correlation between diabetic control and testosterone replacement , meaning those who get good levels of their test see their diabetic control improve .
[patient] yeah .
[doctor] but i have n't seen a lot of data on the impact on cholesterol . regardless , we will take it .
[patient] i agree . i was very impressed with my triglycerides and was just wondering if the test may be what's helping .
[doctor] yeah , that's an unbelievable difference .
[patient] 145 milligrams per deciliter from 265 milligrams per deciliter is awesome . i also read that it- it's cardioprotective .
[doctor] absolutely .
[patient] my red blood cell count has increased .
[doctor] yeah , i saw that . it's fine though .
[patient] stable .
[doctor] your psa today is also , uh , is good also . it's , uh , .6 i think .
[patient] yeah . , is it ?
[doctor] yeah , it was .5 last year and anything under 4 is good .
[patient] nice , that's good news .
[doctor] so it just needs to be checked every year or so .
[patient] so in terms of , uh , estrogen control i've been hearing that indole-3-carbinol , or broccoli extract , supposedly can improve my estrogen levels . have you ever heard of it ?
[doctor] yeah , i've heard of it but i have n't had anybody consistently use it . i mean , your levels are fine and we checked your estra- estradiol and it was not elevated , so .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] i would argue that we could test that in the fall if you want , but we do n't need to do , uh , do any more tests ... any more than test once a year , excuse me .
[patient] okay , what about increasing my testosterone to 175 milligrams ? i'm at 140 now .
[doctor] well , your levels are high .
[patient] are they right now ?
[doctor] well , i mean they were last time .
[patient] yeah but i just- just injected though , or i had right before that was taken .
[doctor] i know . i know you had then , uh , when did you inject this time ?
[patient] i figure i'm on my eighth day today .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] so i'm due to dose on thursday or friday .
[doctor] all right .
[patient] i have a little med calendar and i put checks and ts on it . that helps me .
[doctor] that's a great idea . so look , the biggest issue i've seen , even if your levels today are around 700 , is that your peaks are getting greater than 1,500 , putting you at a higher chance of needing to come off due to blood thickness . and your risk will only astronomically go up the higher the dose that we go on .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] you look well , your levels are good and you're feeling well .
[patient] yeah , i'm feeling good .
[doctor] i'm going to be blunt . unfortunately this happens often where you're feeling good but you want to feel really good . i mean , i get it and this is why people get into problems with this stuff , right ? it's like , back in the day when it was n't prescribed by doctors and people would get it at gyms and stuff and they would take huge doses . and then they would have a heart attack at 50 .
[patient] yeah , they have to be taking a lot .
[doctor] likely they are taking more than testosterone , but still .
[patient] and they are taking stuff for a long time .
[doctor] true . but right now i would not change your dose .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] make sense ?
[patient] it does , i appreciate the discussion .
[doctor] no problem . what pharmacy are you using ? have you changed it or anything ?
[patient] no changes , i use walmart pharmacy . i do need more cialis and finasteride .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] i would prefer the paper prescription .
[doctor] for all of them ?
[patient] sure .
[doctor] all right , will do . i'm gon na get your prescriptions .

MEDICAL NOTE:

CHIEF COMPLAINT

Follow-up.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Nicole Miller is a 71-year-old female who presents for follow-up. The patient was called in for a follow up with me for chronic congestive heart failure with diastolic dysfunction. Her BNP had been 3000 in 03/2021, up to 6000 in 04/2021. She was increasingly dyspneic. We had changed her furosemide to torsemide at 20 mg by mouth daily. The patient is not on a potassium supplement currently. Her lisinopril had also been increased up to 10 mg daily in 03/2021.

I last saw her in 04/2021, and she had reported being interested in having her right knee replaced this summer at East Metropolitan Hospital, so it was recommended that we work to control her cardiovascular status prior to surgery. She is currently scheduled to have surgery on 06/24/2021. She plans to discontinue clopidogrel a week before her surgery.

The patient states that she has lost approximately 3 to 3.5 pounds since her last visit in 04/2021. Some of which may be water weight decreasing. She did report experiencing bilateral leg cramps which she treated with consumption of pickle juice, which did resolve the cramps. She thought the cramps were related to her being cold.

She is still taking iron supplementation. She denies any concerns with defecation.

Regarding her prior symptoms of heartburn, she denies any recent gastrointestinal issues. She notes that her heartburn was severe at one point but resolved after trying Prilosec for 2 weeks in 01/2021. She denies any issues with heartburn since that time and has stopped taking Prilosec altogether. She has since transitioned back to her original ""stomach medication"".

The patient is due for a colonoscopy. She is currently double covered with Medicare and private insurance.

PAST HISTORY

Medical
Chronic Congestive Heart Failure.
Iron deficiency Anemia.

Medications
Prilosec.

FAMILY HISTORY

No family history of colon cancer.

CURRENT MEDICATIONS

Torsemide 20 mg by mouth daily.
Lisinopril 10 mg daily.

RESULTS

Magnesium 1.7, hemoglobin WNL, potassium 3.9, creatinine 0.7, BUN 23.
03/2020 Hgb A1c 5.5.

ASSESSMENT

• Chronic congestive heart failure with mixed presentation.
• Preop examination.
• Diabetes mellitus.
• Colonoscopy

PLAN

Chronic congestive heart failure with mixed presentation.
She had an exacerbation of CHF earlier in the spring. We switched her from furosemide to torsemide and symptomatically, she is doing a lot better. She is about 1.5 kg down in weight. Her breathing is nonlabored. We are going to repeat an EKG today. Otherwise, continue her current regimen. Labs were checked and creatinine is appropriate. Her magnesium is below the preferred 2 at 1.7, with some occurrence of bilateral leg cramping, therefore we will start her on magnesium supplement.

Preop examination.
She is going to be having a right knee replacement at the end of 06/2021. We will schedule a preop check the first week or two of June prior to the surgery. She will discontinue clopidogrel for one week prior to knee replacement surgery; we will provide a reminder to patient of this as well.

Diabetes mellitus.
A1c is 5.5 on last check, so there is no need for a further A1c today. She may need another one prior to her surgery next month.

Colonoscopy.
The patient is overdue for a colonoscopy, which we will try to have done at County Hospital in the next month, prior to a change in her insurance. This is just a screening colonoscopy that she is overdue for. No family history of colon cancer.

The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.

INSTRUCTIONS

Complete EKG today. Schedule a preop checkup 1st or 2nd week of June. Start magnesium supplement. Call the clinic with any questions or new symptoms.","[doctor] next patient is nicole miller . date of birth is 09/18/1949 . patient was called for a follow-up with me for chronic congestive heart failure with diastolic dysfunction . bmp's been , uh , 3,000 in march , and is about six- was up to 6,000 in april . she was increasingly dyspneic . we changed her furosemide and torsemide 20 milligrams by mouth daily . uh to note , the patient is not currently on potassium supplement . her lisinopril had- has also been increased up to 10 milligrams daily in march . also did when i saw her last april . she reported being interested in having her right knee replaced this summer at east metro . it was recommended that we work to control her cardiovascular status before surgery .
[doctor] hey , miss miller , how are you today ?
[patient] i'm doing okay , thank you .
[doctor] i asked you to come in today because we want to keep- we want you to have this knee surgery this summer but we want to keep a close eye on you to make sure a week before your surgery you do n't suddenly go into congestive heart failure and it gets postponed .
[patient] yeah , that would not be good .
[doctor] i see you're scheduled on the 24th for surgery .
[patient] yeah , that's right .
[doctor] okay , good . well it looks like you have lost about 3 , 3 and a half pounds since i saw you last in april . some of that might be water weight , but still , this is positive .
[patient] yeah , i noticed that too . i think the oxyglutinine is helping as well . my urgency to use the bathroom is much better .
[doctor] well that's great .
[patient] yeah , i , i'm pleased about it too .
[doctor] you ever get leg or finger cramps or anything like that ?
[patient] yeah , i had leg cramps the other day , but i thought it might , was maybe just because i was cold as i had my ceiling fan on and fell asleep . i had cramps when i woke up in both legs right here . um i drank pickle juice and it went right away .
[doctor] well do n't , do n't get crazy with the pickle juice because all of the salt in it .
[patient] haha , i know , i only drink about 4 ounces or so .
[doctor] okay good .
[patient] um it went away so i did n't drink anymore . i find it works a lot better than trying to put some cream on my leg .
[doctor] sure just , just keep it in moderation .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] and then are you still on an iron supplement ? and are you using the bathroom okay ?
[patient] uh yes , everything is good .
[doctor] good . how is your heart burn doing ? any problems with that ?
[patient] no , it did get bad for a while so i tried to take some prilosec and then stopped that other one .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] um i did that for like , gosh , i think it was two weeks back in january and have n't had any problems since .
[doctor] great .
[patient] um and after i stopped taking that um i went back to the stomach one , so i'm doing good now .
[doctor] okay and you're still due for a colonoscopy , correct ?
[patient] uh yeah , that's right .
[doctor] all right , let's review your blood work real quick . i checked your hemoglobin level because you have had some anemia in the past but that is still doing great .
[patient] good , that's a relief to hear .
[doctor] your potassium is 3.9 so it's holding steady on the torsemide . your creatinine was .7 not .8 so you're doing well with kidney numbers . your bun may be a tiny bit elevated at 23 which is the number we look for for dehydration sometimes the kidneys , but it's not terrible . um so when i look at your numbers as a whole i think you're tolerating the torsemide okay at the current dose . i also sent out to look at the heart failure number- i sent to look at your heart failure number . there is a test called a bmp that i was monitoring and in march it was up to 3,000 and then went up to 6,000 in april before i made the change . i'm still waiting for those results .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] all in all i think you're doing good on paper though .
[patient] what about , um what's it called , a1c ? does that show up ?
[doctor] um i do n't think i ordered it but i could . your last a1c was 5.5 in march .
[patient] all righty .
[doctor] so your blood sugar is a little bit high , it was 169 today but that kind of depends on what you ate and you were n't fasting for the blood check so i might have to repeat that test for pre-op , but i do n't think we need to do it today .
[patient] all righty that sounds good .
[doctor] i checked your magnesium level because sometimes you uh urinate out magnesium with the water pills but it was normal at 1.7 and your blood pressure is also looking good .
[patient] okay great . that all sounds awesome .
[doctor] all right let's take a quick listen .
[doctor] use my general physical exam template .
[doctor] and take a couple of deep breaths for me .
[doctor] your lungs sound pretty good to me so keep doing what you're doing . um uh , like i said , i think you're doing good overall but let's just talk about a few things .
[patient] all righty .
[doctor] so we often like to keep people with heart problems on magnesium and get their levels up to around the 2-ish range . yours is a little bit less than 2 and we want that 2-ish range because it can help stabilize the heart muscle . so i might recommend putting you on magnesium supplement . it's supposed to be twice a day so that's kind of annoying , but i know you're on other medicines twice a day too , so i think you'll do fine .
[patient] yeah , that'll be okay .
[doctor] great . now before surgery we'll have to get you off your clopidogrel for a week beforehand .
[patient] yes , okay , i have everything written down on my phone , and i have a letter taped to the side of my bed to remind me .
[doctor] perfect ! we will give you a reminder as well . we will also need to complete a pre-op check within two weeks of your surgery during the first or second week of june .
[patient] okay , i'll put that down .
[doctor] you might also have to repeat an ekg before surgery which we could do today . i know i'm sure it feels like you're doing , you're always doing ekgs . um we do n't need to any x-rays of your chest because you had one recently , and we do n't need any more blood work because we did that today .
[patient] yeah , i do a lot of ekgs . i'm basically a regular . but i'm happy to do one today , no problem .
[doctor] lastly , once we get your knee surgery , um we , we should think about getting you a colonoscopy . we can do it here locally because you have medicare . do you have private insurance also ?
[patient] yeah , i have both .
[doctor] okay so yes , you can get it , your colonoscopy , wherever you'd like .
[patient] okay , well my husband's insurance may be running out . might we be able to get the procedure done sooner ? maybe in the next 30 days ? is that okay ?
[doctor] um i can put it in right now for , uh , for county for the next 30 days , and they might be able to get you in within the next few weeks . it should not take , it should not make you ineligible for the surgery . in other words completing a colonoscopy would not delay your surgery .
[patient] okay , good .
[doctor] so let me see . i've been doing one of two things at every one , and everyone is great so it depends more on timing availability of their or for the colonoscopy . we can send you to dr. martin for the surgery who is at county surgical services down here or the other option is valley medical , and they do it at springfield .
[patient] okay , that sounds good .
[doctor] i think either direction they're good technicians of the colon .
[patient] okay , yeah whatever you can get me in , that works great .
[doctor] so i'll call around . now if you get that done and they tell you 10 years then you'll be good to go .
[patient] great , thank you .
[doctor] you're welcome . have a great day . let us know if you need anything else , okay ?
[patient] sounds good .
[doctor] all right , assessment and plan .
[doctor] chronic chf . mixed presentation . had a exacerbation of cf , chf earlier in the spring . we switched her from a furosemide to torsemide and symptomatically she is doing a lot better . she's about 3 , 3 and a half pounds down in weight . breathing is non-labored . going to repeat ekg today but otherwise continue with her current regimen . labs checked and creatinine is appropriate .
[doctor] uh number 2 , pre-op examination . she is , she's having a right knee replacement end of june . also , she would like to have a colonoscopy performed which we'll try to have done at uh bartley regional , rightley regional hospital in the next month , uh , prior to a change in her insurance . this is just a screening colonoscopy that she is overdue for . no family history of colon cancer .
[doctor] uh the next one is diabetes . a1c is 5.1 on the last check so no need for further a1c today . she may need another one prior to her surgery next month though . thanks .",344.6,"Torsemide 20 mg by mouth daily.

MEDICAL NOTE:

CHIEF COMPLAINT

Left ankle pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Matthew Murphy is a pleasant 20-year-old male who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of left ankle pain. The onset of his pain began 2 days ago, when he stepped off of a curb and landed on his left ankle wrong. He denies hearing a pop at the time of the injury, however, he describes his ankle as feeling extended and stretched. He was able to ambulate back to his house after the incident but with pain. He denies any previous injuries to his left ankle. His pain is localized to the lateral aspect of his left ankle and can be rated at 8 out of 10 without medication. When taking ibuprofen his pain level is 7 out of 10. He states he has also iced and elevated his ankle.

SOCIAL HISTORY

Patient reports that he has been working from home since the start of COVID-19 and enjoys taking lots of walks.

MEDICATIONS

Patient reports taking ibuprofen.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Musculoskeletal: Patient reports left ankle pain.

VITALS

Vitals are slightly elevated due to pain level but are otherwise stable.

PHYSICAL EXAM

NEURO: Normal strength and sensation bilaterally.
MSK: Examination of the left ankle: Ecchymosis noted over the lateral malleolus. Edema is present. Tenderness to palpation laterally. No joint laxity appreciated. No bony tenderness to palpation of the foot. Capillary refill is brisk at less than 3 seconds bilaterally. Strong dorsalis pedis pulses bilaterally.

RESULTS

These reveal no fracture or bony abnormalities.

ASSESSMENT

Left ankle sprain of the lateral ligament complex.

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I have had a lengthy discussion with the patient in regards to his current symptoms. We discussed that his symptoms are consistent with an ankle sprain of the lateral ligament complex. The nature of the diagnosis and treatment options were discussed. At this time he will continue to follow the RICE protocol. He will continue to take NSAIDs as needed for pain and swelling. He will also be placed into an Aircast for ankle stabilization and will be provided crutches in order to remain non-weight-bearing. We discussed that it may be a few days before he feels able to tolerate walking. I also advised him that his symptoms will likely start to improve significantly over the next 4 to 6 days.

INSTRUCTIONS

The patient will follow up with me in 2 weeks to assess his progress, sooner if needed.

MEDICAL NOTE:

CHIEF COMPLAINT

Right ankle pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Carolyn Jones is a pleasant 38-year-old female who presents to the clinic today for evaluation of right ankle pain.

The patient sustained an injury to her right ankle when she slipped and fell on ice while taking her garbage out yesterday. This was her first right ankle injury. She believes she heard a pop at the time, but denies any associated numbness or tingling. Initially, she was unable to bear weight on the ankle and required help getting inside; however, she is now able to slightly bear weight but ambulates with an antalgic gait. Ice, elevation, and ibuprofen have been helpful at reducing her pain. She rates her current pain as 4/10, her pain without medication as 6/10, and her pain with medication as 1/10.

Of note, the patient participates in an intramural soccer league but has not been able to play since this injury.

MEDICAL HISTORY

The patient reports that she has had several ankle injuries in the past. This is her first right ankle injury.

SOCIAL HISTORY

The patient reports that she has a history of playing sports. She played soccer in college and is now in an intramural soccer league.

MEDICATIONS

The patient reports that she has been taking ibuprofen.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Musculoskeletal: Reports right ankle pain.
Neurological: Denies right ankle numbness or tingling.

VITALS

Normal

PHYSICAL EXAM

GAIT: antalgic gait
CV: Brisk capillary refill to less than 3 seconds. Strong dorsalis pedis pulse.
NEURO: Sensation in the right ankle is intact to light touch distally.
MSK: Examination of the right ankle: Ecchymosis over the lateral malleolus associated with trace edema in that area. Tenderness to palpation over the anterolateral soft tissue. No laxity on anterior drawer testing or inversion stress testing. No bony tenderness on palpation of the foot or ankle area. Findings are consistent bilaterally.

RESULTS

X-ray images of the right ankle were obtained and reviewed today. These reveal no evidence of fracture.

ASSESSMENT

Lateral ligament complex sprain, Right ankle.

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, her symptoms are consistent with a right ankle sprain of the lateral ligament complex, more specifically the anterior talofibular ligament. We had a lengthy discussion regarding the nature of this injury and the course of treatment. I advised her to keep her leg elevated when she is seated and continue to ice her ankle. She should also continue taking ibuprofen as-needed for pain and inflammation management. She will be placed in an Aircast to help stabilize her ankle, and I am going to order crutches so she can remain non-weight-bearing for the next couple of days. At that point, she can start bearing weight on the ankle as tolerated.

INSTRUCTIONS

The patient will follow up in 2 weeks.

---------------------------------------------","[doctor] good morning carolyn how are you

[doctor] okay you know and i see here that you have a history of playing sports looks like you played soccer in college and then played a little bit of a inner marrow soccer now
[patient] yeah
[doctor] i'm i'm guessing you probably have n't been able to do that since you hurt your ankle
[patient] no i have not been
[doctor] so did you hear about the new major league soccer stadium and team that's coming to town they opened in the this year actually they built the stadium have you been down there yet

MEDICAL NOTE:

CHIEF COMPLAINT

Right knee pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Virginia Phillips is a pleasant 53-year-old female who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of right knee pain. The onset of her pain began 7 days ago, when she was playing basketball and another player ran into her. She states that she fell to the ground and landed on her side. She denies hearing or feeling a pop at the time of the injury. The patient localizes her pain to the medial aspect of her knee. She used ice and an ACE wrap right after the injury. Today, she notes that she has been doing exercises, ice, and Mobic for pain control.

MEDICAL HISTORY

The patient reports she is a diabetic who takes her blood sugar every morning.

SOCIAL HISTORY

Patient reports that she plays basketball at the Y for fun.

MEDICATIONS

Patient reports that she takes metformin 500 mg twice a day.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Musculoskeletal: Reports right knee pain.

PHYSICAL EXAM

MSK: Examination of the right knee: No pain to palpation of the lateral aspect of the right knee. Pain with palpation on the medial aspect of the knee. Ecchymosis and swelling on the medial aspect of the knee. Effusion is appreciated. Decreased ROM. Negative varus and valgus stress test.

RESULTS

X-rays of the right knee taken in office today reveal the bony alignment in good position. There is no evidence of any fractures. There is effusion present.

ASSESSMENT

Right knee pain, possible medial collateral ligament strain.

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I have had a lengthy discussion with the patient in regard to her current symptoms. I have prescribed the patient meloxicam 15 mg once a day to treat the pain and swelling. She was advised to stop taking any anti-inflammatory such as Motrin or Advil. I have also recommended that the patient attend formal physical therapy to strengthen her right knee. I have also advised her to continue to use the ACE wrap and wear a right knee brace for a few days. She should continue light walking with her brace on. The patient was advised to stop basketball until she follows up in 7 days.

Regarding her diabetes, she should continue to monitor her blood sugars daily. She should reach out to her primary care physician if she sees an increase in her blood sugars due to loss of activity.

INSTRUCTIONS

The patient will follow up with me in 7 days to check on her progress. If her swelling has not improved, we will consider obtaining a CT or MRI of the right knee to evaluate for a possible medial collateral ligament strain.

---------------------------------------------","[doctor] hi virginia how're you today
[patient] i'm good thanks how are you
[doctor] good so you know you got that knee x-ray when you first came in but tell me a little bit about what happened
[patient] i was playing basketball and jerry ran into me and the inside of my knee hurts
[doctor] okay did you fall to the ground or did you just kinda plant and he pushed and you went one way and your knee did n't
[patient] i did fall to the ground
[doctor] you did fall to the ground okay and did you land on the kneecap i mean did it hurt a lot were you able to get up and continue on
[patient] i landed on my side i was not able to continue on
[doctor] okay so you get off the off the court is jerry a good player you just got ta ask that question
[patient] not really
[doctor] no
[patient] he does n't have much game
[doctor] okay okay well you know i love basketball i'm a little short for the game but i absolutely love to watch basketball so it's really cool that you're out there playing it so tell me about a little bit about where it hurts
[patient] on the inside
[doctor] on the inside of it okay and after the injury did they do anything special for you or you know did you get ice on it right away or try anything
[patient] i had ice and an ace wrap
[doctor] you had ice and what
[patient] an ace wrap
[doctor] and an ace wrap okay now how many days ago was this exactly
[patient] seven
[doctor] seven days ago okay yeah your right knee still looks a little swollen for seven days ago so i'm gon na go ahead and now i also see that you're diabetic and that you take five hundred milligrams of metformin twice a day are you still you're still on that medication is that correct
[patient] correct
[doctor] and do you check your blood sugars every morning at home
[patient] every morning
[doctor] okay great and since this i'm the reason i'm asking all these questions i'm a little concerned about the inactivity with your your knee pain and you know how diabetes you need to be very you know active and and taking your medicine to keep that under control so you know may wan na continue to follow up with your pcp for that diabetes as we go through here and just watch your blood sugars extra as we go through that now i'm gon na go ahead and examine your your right knee and when i push on the outside does that hurt at all
[patient] no
[doctor] okay and when i push on this inside where it's a little swollen does that hurt
[patient] yes
[doctor] yeah okay i'm just gon na ask a question did you hear or feel a pop in your knee when you were doing this
[patient] i did not no
[doctor] you did not okay okay what are you doing for the pain today
[patient] some exercises ice and mobic
[doctor] okay okay so i'm gon na continue all of my exam when i go ahead and pull on your knee the first thing i'm looking at is i do see some ecchymosis and swelling on the inside of that right knee and when i push around that knee i can see that there is fluid in the knee a little bit of fluid in the knee we call that effusion so i can appreciate some of that effusion and that could be either fluid or blood at this point from the injury that you had now you do have pain with palpation on the medial aspect of that right knee and that's that's concerning for me when i'm gon na just i just wan na move your knee a little bit it does n't look like when i extend it and flex it that you have a full range of motion does it hurt a lot when i moved it back a little more than normal
[patient] yes it hurts
[doctor] okay okay yeah so you do have some decreased range of motion in that right knee now i'm just gon na sit here and and lay you back and i'm gon na pull on your knee and twist your knee a little bit okay you currently there is a negative varus and valgus stress test that's really important so here's what i'm thinking for that right knee i think you have may have a medial collateral ligament strain from you know maybe the twisting motion be right before you fell to the ground i want you to continue to use an ace wrap i'm gon na give you a right knee brace we're gon na wear that for a few days and then i'm gon na send you to physical therapy so we can continue strengthening the muscles around the right knee now that x-ray as far as the x-ray results that x-ray that i did it this morning in the office the the bony alignment's in good position i do n't see any evidence of any fractures i do notice the the effusion around the right knee just a small amount of fluid but we're just gon na continue to watch that i'm gon na give you a prescription i'd like you to stop taking any of the nonsteroidals that you're taking the motrin or advil whichever one of those and i'm gon na give you meloxicam fifteen milligrams and i want you to take that daily for the pain and swelling i want you to just continue exercising with the the braces and everything on so if you can you can get out and do some light walking that'll be good and then again for your diabetes like i said just continue to watch those blood sugars daily and if you start to see any significant increase in them because of your loss of activity just reach out to your primary care physician now do you have any questions for me
[patient] when can i play basketball again
[doctor] yeah that's a great question i'm gon na ask well my first off i want to see you back here in in seven days you know in a week i want you to make an appointment we're gon na relook at it we're gon na determine if that swelling got any worse and if we need to go on to potentially ordering like a cat scan or an mri of that knee to look and see if there was any significant damage to the ligament so that's for for sure for seven days you're not gon na be playing basketball now are you in a ligue or is that just you get like pick up basketball
[patient] i just played the wife with fun
[doctor] okay okay good that's a great activity like i said i wish i could play now i i also know your your family do n't they own that sports store down right off a main street that sells a lot of sporting equipment

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

1. CHF.
- Medical Reasoning: The patient’s recent epsiode resulting in the emergency room visit was likely caused by his dietary indiscretion and uncontrolled hypertension that we have been monitoring.
- Patient Education and Counseling: I reviewed the echocardiogram results with the patient and discussed the importance of following dietary restrictions. I encouraged the patient to take his medication on a consistent basis. I advised him to purchase a scale to weigh himself daily.
- Medical Treatment: He will continue Bumex 2 mg once daily. He was provided with a referral to a nutritionist in consultation for further assistance with his dietary requirements to lower his sodium intake.

2. Hypertension.
- Medical Reasoning: This is currently uncontrolled.
- Patient Education and Counseling: I explained the importance of taking his medication on a daily basis. I encouraged the patient to purchase a blood pressure cuff and track his blood pressures.
- Medical Treatment: He will continue Cozaar 100 mg daily as well as the Norvasc 5 mg once daily. I will order a renal artery ultrasound for further evaluation.

3. Systolic ejection murmur.
- Medical Reasoning. Stable.

Patient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.

INSTRUCTIONS

MEDICAL NOTE:

CHIEF COMPLAINT

Right foot ulcer.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Jeremy Roberts is a 79-year-old male who presents today for evaluation of a right foot ulcer. He reports an ulcer on his right foot has been present for approximately 6 to 8 weeks. He first noticed the ulcer after working outside. There is no associated pain, however, he feels the ulcer may have worsened from when he first noticed it. He denies experiencing any fevers or chills. He does however experience tension headaches quite frequently. He denies any pain in his calves when he walks. At this time the patient does not have a podiatrist for yearly foot exams.

He is a diabetic and takes insulin. His blood sugar has been running higher than normal and his last hemoglobin A1c was higher than 9. Occasionally he will also experience numbness and tingling in his feet, especially with colder weather.

In terms of his heart disease, the patient sustained a heart attack in 2018 and underwent stent placement at the right coronary artery. He is currently taking aspirin 81 mg daily. He denies chest pain or shortness of breath.

MEDICAL HISTORY

Patient reports history of diabetes and heart disease. He sustained a heart attack in 2018.

SURGICAL HISTORY

Patient reports undergoing stent placement at the right coronary artery.

SOCIAL HISTORY

Patient reports he is a former smoker. He previously smoked 2 packs a day for 20 years and was able to stop smoking approximately 4 years ago. Currently he is not very active but he does work around the house.

MEDICATIONS

Patient reports taking aspirin 81 mg daily and insulin.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Constitutional: Denies fevers and chills.
Cardiovascular: Denies chest pain.
Respiratory: Denies dyspnea.
Skin: Patient reports right foot ulcer.
Neurological: Patient reports headaches and numbness and tingling in feet.

VITALS

No fever.
Blood pressure: 127/80
Heart rate: 60s

PHYSICAL EXAM

CV: 2/6 systolic ejection murmur heard at the left base.
RESPIRATORY: Clear to auscultation bilaterally
NECK: No jugular venous distention or carotid bruits
MSK: Examination of the right lower extremity: No palpable dorsalis pedis or posterior tibial pulses. There is a 2 x 3 cm ulcerated lesion on the right lateral foot near the 5th metacarpal metatarsophalangeal joint. No associated cellulitis. No pain to palpation of the right foot. There is associated granulation tissue and some slight purulent discharge from the wound.

ASSESSMENT

1. Non-healing ulcer, right foot
2. Diabetes
3. Coronary artery disease

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination findings today, I have had a lengthy discussion with the patient in regards to his current symptoms. We discussed that his right foot ulcer is fairly sizable and will require wound care. I advised him that the ulcer does not appear to be healing and that further studies will be needed to assess if he has adequate blood supply to heal his foot wound. He was advised that due to his diabetes it is possible surgical intervention such as stent placement or bypass surgery may be required to improve his blood supply. I also advised him that I believe we will be able to heal his wound. At this time, I have recommended continued wound care and for him to also continue taking aspirin 81 mg daily. We will order an arterial ultrasound of the lower extremities. He will also be referred to podiatry for a consult.

Regarding his diabetes, this appears to be unstable as the patient reports his last hemoglobin a1c was greater than 9 and is now experiencing a non-healing right foot ulcer. We discussed the importance of blood sugar control as this will impact his wound healing. At this time, I have recommended that he follow-up with his primary care physician for further care.

The patient's coronary artery disease is currently stable. It is recommended that he continue to take his statin as prescribed. I will contact his cardiologist for medical clearance should surgical intervention be required for his non-healing right foot ulcer.

[doctor] okay alright and have you had any fever or chills
[patient] no no no fever or chills you know i kinda you know get headaches pretty often i do n't know if that you know i do n't know if that's a stress or but you know always have like the tension headaches in the front
[doctor] okay and do you have do you have neuropathy where you get like numbing and tingling in your feet
[patient] occasionally yeah occasionally especially when it's like colder outside
[doctor] mm-hmm kinda feels like it takes a little longer to
[patient] warm up but yeah i kinda have some sensation in in all my extremities
[doctor] okay alright and then are you are you a smoker or did you smoke
[patient] i did back you know kind of years ago i did but yeah i have n't smoked anything in in good number of years
[doctor] okay alright when did you stop smoking
[patient] couple years ago maybe four or so years ago
[doctor] okay alright and how many packs a day would you smoke
[patient] gosh back then yeah was at least two
[doctor] okay alright how many years did you smoke for like twenty
[patient] yeah at least twenty yeah twenty plus years
[doctor] okay alright now any other symptoms do you have any problems when you walk down the street do you get any pain in your calves at all when you walk
[patient] no no no no pain you know just kind of you know it's just i know that it's there
[doctor] okay and you said you're active you're out in the yard and things like that do you go on long walks at all or no
[patient] no no you know it's you know i just kinda feel like i've been just trying to take it easy lately
[doctor] mm-hmm
[patient] but yeah most most of the stuff i've been doing is just kind of hanging around the house
[doctor] okay alright so we talked a little bit about your diabetes let's talk about your heart disease now your heart disease you had a heart attack in twenty eighteen we put a stent into your right coronary artery you're still taking your medications for that you're still on your aspirin
[patient] i am yes yeah i do the baby aspirin every day
[doctor] okay alright and any chest pain or shortness of breath or anything like that no no yeah no nothing more than yeah i would n't attribute anything
[patient] okay and do you have a podiatrist for your yearly foot exams
[doctor] no i i i do n't okay alright alright well let's go ahead i wan na just do a quick physical exam i'm just gon na be calling out some of my exam findings so your vital signs here in the office you do n't have any fever so that's good your blood pressure is great it's like one twenty seven over eighty and your heart rate is nice and slow in the sixties on your neck exam i do n't appreciate any jugular venous distention or any carotid bruits on your lung exam your lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally on your heart exam you do have a two out of six systolic ejection murmur heard at the left base and on your lower extremity exam i do n't appreciate any palpable dorsalis pedis or posterior tibial pulses there is a two by three centimeter ulcerated lesion on the right lateral foot near the fifth metacarpal metatarsophalangeal joint there is no associated cellulitis does it hurt when i press here
[patient] no
[doctor] there is no pain to palpation of the right foot there is associated granulation tissue and some slight purulent discharge from the wound okay so what does all that mean that just means that you have this ulcer that's you know fairly sizable with i think we need to do some good wound care on it let's talk a little bit about my assessment and plan so you know i you have a nonhealing ulcer of your right foot so we need to do some studies on you to see if you have an adequate blood supply to heal this foot wound and since you since you probably do n't because of your diabetes you're here in a vascular surgeon's office we may have to go ahead and talk about being able to open up some of your arteries to improve the blood supply to your foot so that might mean getting a stent to one of your arteries in your legs to open up the blood supply it might mean mean that we might have to do some bypass surgery to to improve the blood supply to your foot in order to heal that that wound i do think that you'll be able to heal it i do n't think that we need to do anything drastic i want you to continue with your aspirin because that will help
[patient] any questions
[doctor] yeah i mean is this do we have to do any more tests or anything what are you we're gon na do an arterial ultrasound i'm going to go ahead and order an arterial ultrasound of your lower extremities to see what the blood supply is like and then i'm gon na go ahead and order a podiatry consult because i want them to see this wound and improve the wound care that you're doing and then for your next problem your diabetes i wan na go ahead and talk to your primary care physician we need to get your diabetes better controlled because that impacts your wound healing as well okay
[patient] sure
[doctor] sure understood alright and for your last issue your coronary artery disease continue with your statin and i will talk to your cardiologist in case you need a procedure to see if you're cleared from a medical standpoint okay
[patient] okay perfect
[doctor] alright
[patient] perfect thank you so much

---------------------------------------------","[doctor] hi virginia how are you today what brings you in
[patient] i'm doing alright i started seeing this new pcp last year and you know she has been doing a lot of changes to my medication and making sure everything is up to date and she my noticed that my blood pressure has been quite high so she added to medications but and but i you know i've been taking them i've been really good and i i before i was n't but now i am and we're still having a hard time controlling my blood pressure so she thought it would be a good idea for me to see you especially since she noted some on my last blood work she said something about my kidneys
[doctor] okay yeah so okay let's before i dive into a lot of that tell me a little bit about how you've been feeling
[patient] i would say you know most of the days i feel fine i'm still busy at work i definitely can tell though when my blood pressure is high
[doctor] okay you measure it at home you you you measure your blood pressure at home
[patient] yeah i she wanted me to get a blood pressure cuff so i did start getting checking my blood pressures probably like a few times a week
[doctor] okay
[patient] and so then i noticed that it has been getting higher the other day was even as high as one seventy over ninety
[doctor] wow
[patient] so i did call my pcp and she increased the meds again
[doctor] yeah okay now i i just have a couple questions about that are you using a an electronic blood pressure recorder or do you have somebody help you at home
[patient] yeah she i have a a electronic one an electronic arm one
[doctor] okay okay yeah that's good that's good and have you ever tried do you go to cvs at all
[patient] yeah i i do but i've noticed like since the pandemic i do n't see the blood pressures anymore
[doctor] okay okay yeah i i thought the one down on main street they i thought they just brought that one back so
[patient] did they
[doctor] yeah
[patient] that's good to know
[doctor] you may wan na check that but okay so that's good but i what i'd like you to do with that is i'd like you to keep a record of them for me for my next visit with you so let's talk a little bit about your diet tell me how how is your diet what what are the what kind of foods do you like what do you eat normally
[patient] alright do you want the honest answer
[doctor] well yeah that would be better
[patient] so i really you know with everything going on i really been trying to get better but i mean during football season it's really difficult i really love watching my games so have a lot of pizza wings subs like i said i've been trying to cut down especially on days where there is no games but it probably could be better
[doctor] okay i think we all can say that but i do wan na just hey i do n't know that if you've tried it or not but there is a new restaurant down on fifth street and it is nothing but solids and i you know when i heard this i was like okay yeah it's just another these solids are absolutely amazing so if you ever get a chance yeah if you ever get a chance try try that i mean i think you would enjoy them because they're salads that they make are just out unbelievable so let me go ahead and i just have a few more questions and i'm gon na just ask these in in order and you just tell me and then we will come back and talk about them do you have any headaches
[patient] really just when my blood pressure gets really high i have some mild headaches but otherwise i do n't have it on a regular basis
[doctor] okay what about chest pain
[patient] no chest pain
[doctor] shortness of breath
[patient] no shortness of breath
[doctor] even with exertion
[patient] even with exertion
[doctor] okay do you have any swelling in your lower extremities at all that you noticed
[patient] not if i'm on my feet for a long time i'll notice a little bit of swelling but otherwise no
[doctor] okay and then a couple other family history questions anybody in the family have kidney disease or significant high blood pressure
[patient] both my parents do have high blood pressure and one of them did have kidney disease
[doctor] okay okay and in the the the form that you filled out when you came in it says that you are on ten milligrams of norvasc daily and carvedilol twenty five milligrams twice a day is those the medicines you're on
[patient] yes i was also on lisinopril before but with the adjustments yeah those are the ones i'm on
[doctor] okay and so here's where i think we are going to go do you take any nonsteroidals like advil or motrin or aleve
[patient] yeah just once in a while for my like any knee pain or back pain that i have but again not like everyday
[doctor] okay and then lastly what kind of alcohol intake do you have you know do you consider how many drinks a week is really what i'm looking for
[patient] i'll have a couple of beers during the week and like one or two on the weekends
[doctor] okay okay so lem me do a quick physical examination so i looked at your vitals when you came in today and your blood pressure it's still high it's one sixty nine over seventy four your heart rate was eighty eight and your oxygenation was ninety eight percent so those are all fairly good except that blood pressure's a little higher than we'd like to see now when i look at your neck i do n't see any jugular vein distention and i'm gon na listen here real quick no i do n't hear any carotid bruits i'm gon na listen to your lungs okay your lungs are clear and let me listen quickly to your heart i do hear that a two over six systolic ejection murmur and we'll we're gon na have to take a little bit look extra look at that that's when i i can hear an extra sound when i'm listening to your heart and you do have a small amount of one plus pitting edema bilaterally now i did so you do have that your diagnosis is uncontrolled hypertension you know and i think you're aware that that's what your your physician's been treating you for and most of the time this cause is is the cause of this is multifactorial it's not that there is just one thing causing it so we may need to be changing your medicine around and i'm gon na talk to your doctor but first thing before we make any more medication changes i want to order some tests first to rule out if there is any specific cause for this so first order will be a renal artery ultrasound and what i'm looking for there is that there is no areas of areas of narrowing in the the blood vessels of your kidneys that would be the cause of your hypertension in addition to that i'm gon na order a you get another urine collection some morning aldosterone levels reining levels and a twenty four hour urine and these things can really show me if there is any problems with your adrenal glands again this is a lot of big words but you know i'm i i'll write this all out for you i want you to decrease your alcohol i know you like those beers but let's bring it down to maybe one a week or two a week just to get those down lower and then your salt intake you need to be very judicious about decreasing that salt intake i'm gon na give you a referral to a nutritionist to discuss those changes for that you need and and they will help you get that cleared up and then finally stop taking any nonsteroidal medicines such as your advil or motrin the only thing i really want to want you taking is tylenol for any pain right now i am gon na prescribe one medicine and that's cardura four milligrams and i want you to take that once a day and that's good to see if that can help us with your blood pressure and then finally three weeks i'd like you to return i want you to record all of your blood pressures that you take over the next three weeks and bring them into the office but most importantly if you can try to take them at the same time everyday that would be beneficial for me any questions for me
[patient] no i i just it's a lot so i i'm hoping this will work and this will get it under control
[doctor] yeah i i think you know this will be you know this we're gon na spend some time together so i'm glad to have you as a patient but you know we got ta try to get this under control and i'm gon na i'll be talking to your pcp just to let them know that you know what my plans are and we'll stay real in sync on treating this as we move forward does that sound like a plan
[patient] that sounds good thank you
[doctor] okay take care i'll talk to you later

MEDICAL NOTE:

CHIEF COMPLAINT

Left arm pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

He reports that his left arm pain began approximately 2 weeks ago. He woke around 2:00 am with intense pain in his left arm and hand. He applied ice and after 2-3 hours, the pain improved and he was able to go back to sleep, the pain did not return until that evening. After several nights of experiencing the left arm and hand pain, he was seen by Betty Ross, PA-C. She suspected a pinched nerve and completed x-rays of the cervical spine, prescribed gabapentin and prednisone, and referred the patient to us. The patient has benefited from the gabapentin and prednisone, reporting improvement of pain at night.

The pain initially was encountered at night, but the patient notes that the symptoms carry into the next day. He denies pain when moving his neck, turning his head, and moving his shoulder.

Mr. Clark does report a history of a left finger injury, stating “it rarely works”, and neuropathy in one leg from his knee to his foot which he receives 1% disability for. The patient is a veteran.

PAST HISTORY

Medical
Peripheral neuropathy.

SOCIAL HISTORY

The patient is a veteran and receives 1% disability.

CURRENT MEDICATIONS

Gabapentin tablet.
Prednisone tablet.

PHYSICAL EXAM

Constitutional
Elderly Caucasian male in no apparent distress. Presents in wheelchair.

Neurologic
Upper extremities: 1+ bilateral biceps, triceps, brachioradialis, reflexes bilaterally, negative. Negative Hoffman's
Gait: Not assessed today.

Strength
Upper extremities: Normal throughout the biceps, triceps, deltoid, grip strength, and finger abduction, bilaterally.
Sensation: Intact to light touch throughout the upper and lower extremities.

Musculoskeletal
Cervical: Nontender over cervical spine. Mildly restricted cervical extension and right and left lateral rotation, which is symmetric, which gives him mild lateral neck pain, but no radicular pain. Spurling's maneuver is benign.

RESULTS

X-ray Cervical Spine, 06/04/2021.
Impression: Significant disc degeneration at C5-6 and to a lesser extent C4-5 and C3-4. Significant lower facet arthropathy. C6-7 and C7-T1 are difficult to visualize in the current x-rays.

ASSESSMENT

• Left upper extremity neuropathy, suspicious for cervical radiculopathy, possible contribution of peripheral neuropathy
• Neck pain in the setting of arthritis and disc generation

PLAN

I suspect that this is a flare of cervical radiculopathy. I am going to set him up for a cervical MRI. We will tentatively plan for a left C7-T1 epidural afterwards, although the exact level will be pending the MRI results. He will continue his home exercise program as well as twice daily gabapentin. We will follow up with him afterwards to determine his level of relief. He denies any blood thinners.

This plan was discussed in detail with the patient who is in agreement.

INSTRUCTIONS

Continue home exercise program and twice daily gabapentin. Schedule MRI and epidural injection. Follow-up after epidural.

---------------------------------------------","[doctor] dictating on donald clark . date of birth , 03/04/1937 . chief complaint is left arm pain . hello , how are you ?
[patient] good morning .
[doctor] it's nice to meet you . i'm dr. miller .
[patient] it's nice to meet you as well .
[doctor] so , i hear you are having pain this arm . is that correct ?
[patient] that's correct .
[doctor] okay . and it seems like it's worse at night ?
[patient] well , right now the hand is .
[doctor] mm-hmm .
[patient] and the thing started about two weeks ago . i woke up about two o'clock in the morning and it was just hurting something awful .
[doctor] uh- .
[patient] and then i laid some ice on it and it finally did ease up .
[doctor] okay , that's good .
[patient] so i got up , i sat on the side of the bed and held my arm down , thinking it would , like , help the circulation , but it did n't .
[doctor] okay , i see .
[patient] and so , after a while , when it eased off , maybe about four , five am , i laid back down and it did n't start up again .
[doctor] mm-hmm , okay .
[patient] um . i went back to sleep but for several nights this happened , like , over and over . so , i finally went to see the doctor , and i do n't really recall her name .
[doctor] okay . yeah , i think i know who you're talking about , though .
[patient] um , she's the one who sent me to you , so , i , i would , i would think so . but when i went to her after the third time it happened and she checked me out , she said it was most likely coming from a pinched nerve .
[doctor] probably . uh , do you notice that moving your neck or turning your head seems to bother your arm ?
[patient] uh , no .
[doctor] okay . is moving your shoulder uncomfortable at all ?
[patient] no .
[doctor] and do you notice it at other times besides during the night ?
[patient] um , some days . if it bothers me at night , then the day following , it usually will bother me some .
[doctor] okay . and do you just notice it in the hand , or does it seem to be going down the whole arm ?
[patient] well , it starts there and goes all the way down the arm .
[doctor] okay . have you noticed any weakness in your hand at all ?
[patient] uh , yes .
[doctor] okay . like , in terms of gripping things ?
[patient] yeah .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] uh , this finger , i hurt it some time ago as well .
[doctor] really ?
[patient] yeah . it does n't work properly . or , it works very rarely .
[doctor] gotcha . and did i hear that she gave you some prednisone and some oral steroids , or ?
[patient] uh , well , she gave me some numbing medicine . it helped a little bit . the other two were a neck pill and gabapentin . uh , you should have my full list in your notes , though . since then it has n't really bothered me at night . also , just so you know , i am a va and i'm one percent disabled from this leg , um , issues from my knees down to my feet .
[doctor] okay . is it neuropathy ?
[patient] uh , yep .
[doctor] gotcha . that is good to know . all right , well , let's go ahead and take a look .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] all right . so , to start , i'm gon na have you do something for me . uh , just go ahead and tilt your chin as far as you can down to your chest . okay , good . and now , go the other way , tilting your chin up as far as you can . now , does that seem to bother you at all ? okay . and now , come back to normal , just look and turn your head as far as you can that way . great . and now , as far as you can towards that wall . uh , does that seem to bother you at all ?
[patient] no . well , actually , i do feel a little strain .
[doctor] okay . so , you feel it in the neck a little bit ?
[patient] yeah , just a little strain .
[doctor] okay . uh , now squeeze my fingers as hard as you can with both hands . great . now , hold your arms like this .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] and i'm going to try to strain your arms and try to keep them as stiff as you can . do n't let me strain it . okay , good . good . now , when i , i'm just touching your hands like this . does it seem to feel about the same in both hands ?
[patient] uh , yes .
[doctor] okay . all right . so , i do agree with betty . uh , more than likely , this seems like it would be coming from your neck . that's the most common reason that causes what , what you're experiencing . and i looked at an x-ray of your neck , and you do seem to have a lot of arthritis there , and there does seem to be potential for a disc to be pushing on a nerve . and now , what i do n't have is an mri , which would show me , uh , kind of exactly where the nerve roots are getting pinched off .
[patient] i see .
[doctor] so , gabapentin can help a little bit with the nerve pain , and what i would like to do is potentially set you up for an epidural . and what that is is it , it's a focused anti-inflammatory medicine , excuse me , that works behind the nerve roops that , nerve roots that we are thinking might be getting squished off . it can often help alleviate your symptoms , and i do need to get an mri of your neck . um , i know we have had one of your lower back , but i need one of your neck to see exactly where the roots are getting pinched off . so , what i can do is tentatively set you up for an epidural , but before you do that , we do need to get that mri so i can see right where i need to put the medicine for your epidural . uh , what do you think of that ?
[patient] i think that sounds good to me .
[doctor] okay , good . and just to confirm , do you take any blood thinners ? i do n't think i saw any on your medicine list .
[patient] uh , no , i do n't .
[doctor] okay , good . and what i would have you do is continue with the gabapentin . um , are you taking 300 or 100 ?
[patient] um , not sure . my lady friend helps me handle this stuff .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] i am taking eliquis , though .
[doctor] okay . um , so whatever you are doing you can just keep doing it , and i'm going to set you up for the epidural and imaging study , um , just so i know right where to put the medicine . and i will follow up with you after s- um , that's in . we can do the shot , just to make sure your arm is feeling better . sound good ?
[patient] sounds good . for the last couple of nights , though , my neck has not been bothering me .
[doctor] okay . s- um , so , presumably what's happening , then , is when you're sleeping your neck is kind of gets off-tilt , uh , kilter , and it compresses the nerve roots there . now , if you think you're doing fine , we could hold off , but at the very la- least , i'd like to update that mri of yours and see what's going on , because probably this is something that will likely flare up again .
[patient] yeah , it , it has been for the last week , so , i understand .
[doctor] okay . all right . well , do you want to do that work-up and do the epidural , or do you think you're doing fine and you want to wait ?
[patient] well , my hand is still bothering me .
[doctor] okay . so , you're saying your neck is not bothering you but the hand is . okay . so then , let's just stick with the plan . mri of the neck , so we can see where the nerve roots may be compressed , that's giving your hand the issue . and then , we're going to set you up with the epidural .
[patient] okay . sounds good .
[doctor] all right . so , keep going with the gabapentin . i will order the imaging of your neck , and the shot will hopefully help some with those symptoms in your hand , and then we'll follow up afterwards .
[patient] all right . is the mri today ?
[doctor] um , you probably ca n't do it today , but let me talk with roy and see how soon we can get it done . just give me a quick minute , and then roy will come in and get things scheduled as soon as we can .
[patient] all right .

CHIEF COMPLAINT

Smoking cessation.

MEDICAL HISTORY

Patient reports a history of type 2 diabetes, gout, and a 2/6 Systolic ejection murmur.

SOCIAL HISTORY

Patient reports he is a smoker.

MEDICATIONS

Patient reports taking allopurinol.

VITALS

Oxygen Saturation: 98% on room air.
Blood Pressure: 128/88 mmHg.
Heart Rate: 68 beats per minute.
Respiratory Rate: 16 breaths per minute.

PHYSICAL EXAM

Neck
- General Examination: Neck is supple without lymphadenopathy. No carotid bruits.

Respiratory
- Auscultation of Lungs: Clear bilaterally. No expiratory wheezes, rales, or rhonchi.

Cardiovascular
- Auscultation of Heart: Regular rate. 2/6 systolic ejection murmur.

Hematology/Lymphatic/Immunology
- Palpation: No enlarged lymph nodes.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

1. Nicotine dependence.
- Medical Reasoning: The patient has a long history of smoking cigarettes. He is currently smoking 1.5 packs per day. He is highly motivated to cease smoking as he is preparing to become a father.
- Patient Education and Counseling: I applaud the patient on making this first step to stop smoking. I reassured him that with absolute 100% certainty that I will be with him every step of the way. I explained to the patient that stress can often be a trigger for smoking. He received handouts today for common smoking triggers. I advised him to be watchful and monitor his stress level, not only regarding work, but also his impending fatherhood. The patient and I discussed coping mechanisms for when he encounters stressful situations. I encouraged him to maintain his gym routine, engage in meditation, and try adding in yoga to help further reduce his stress levels. We discussed additional cessation aids.
- Medical Treatment: The patient has chosen his birthday, as a quit date. On that day, I am going to start him with a 21 mg nicotine patch, and the goal will be to decrease that over time. We will work together to decrease the dosage of the nicotine patch, so there are not necessarily any hard dates in mind. I recommend he change the patch location each day as that will help reduce or avoid any skin irritation that can occur if he re-uses the same location repeatedly.

2. Type 2 diabetes.
- Medical Reasoning: Stable.
- Patient Education and Counseling: We discussed that continuing to follow a healthy diet and perform regular exercise will help to maintain his blood glucose levels.
- Medical Treatment: We will continue to monitor his type 2 diabetes. Hemoglobin A1c is ordered to be completed by his next visit in 2 weeks.

3. History of gout.
- Medical Reasoning: Stable with medication.
- Patient Education and Counseling: I advised him to continue to watch for foods that will exacerbate his uric acid levels.
- Medical Treatment: He will continue his allopurinol.

Patient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.

INSTRUCTIONS

I would like to see him again in 2 weeks to discuss how things are going and to reevaluate the nicotine patch dosage.

MEDICAL NOTE:

CHIEF COMPLAINT

Right hip pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Elizabeth Reyes is a 56-year-old female who presents for the evaluation of pain in her right hip and groin region. Her symptoms started on 02/2020 and has progressively worsened. She is employed as an RN and notes that her symptoms began while she was working and walking around the infusion room at Johnson. Initially the pain would only happen when she took a step back, but the pain has progressed and now occurs with any type of movement involving her right hip and groin. She describes that her hip will sometimes “catch” when she moves, causing her to fall on occasion. The pain improves when she is still and stops moving. She rates her pain as 2-7/10.

Starting in 2018, the patient intentionally lost 110 pounds through Weight Watchers. She has maintained the weight loss and her weight has been stabile for the past 1 year. She has a history of several bulging discs, but the pain has significantly reduced due to her weight loss. Today, she reports no back pain.

She denies fever, chills, new onset of bowel or bladder dysfunction, tingling or numbness.

Cervical spine exam: No tenderness is elicited. Range of motion is full in all planes without pain. Spurling's test is negative.
Lumbar spine exam: Range of motion is decreased in extension and lateral flexion without pain. No tenderness is elicited in the midline.
Sacroiliac joint exam: Bilateral sacroiliac joints are nontender to palpation.
Bilateral hip exam: Range of motion is decreased in the right hip with pain in the groin on internal and external rotation. Resisted right hip flexion causes pain in the right groin region. Bilateral trochanteric regions are nontender to palpation.

Motor bulk and tone are normal in both lower extremities. Motor strength testing reveals no focal motor weakness in the lower extremities. Deep tendon reflexes are 1+ throughout. No focal sensory deficit is noted.

RESULTS

MR arthrogram of the right hip completed on 06/03/2021 reveals evidence of high-grade chondromalacia involving the anterosuperior right acetabulum with subchondral marrow edema and cyst formation.

ASSESSMENT

• Right hip degenerative joint disease.

PLAN

I discussed the clinical and radiological findings with the patient. Treatment options discussed are low impact exercises, use of analgesics as needed, and use of a cane to offload the right hip. She would like to proceed with a cortisone injection into her right hip joint. We will administer the injection today. I reviewed the procedure in detail, including the risks of the injection related to the use of steroid in the COVID setting. She understands the risks and would like to proceed with the injection.

INSTRUCTIONS

Schedule a follow up appointment in 3 months to assess her pain. If needed, a second injection may be administered.","[doctor] good morning ms. reyes !

[doctor] okay okay so we are gon na go ahead if it's okay with you and start your physical exam reviewing your vitals so vitals look good especially your oxygen especially with the chemotherapy you've been getting and the cough so your oxygen looks good so i'm happy with that so now i'm just examining your neck especially with your sore throat and i do n't appreciate any cervical lymphadenopathy and also no supraclavicular adenopathy listening to your heart you have a nice regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs that i appreciate now on your lung exam when you're taking some deep breaths i do notice some crackles in your lungs bilaterally and what that means is there is there is some faint sounds that i'm hearing which could represent some fluid there so on looking at your skin exam on your chest you do have some erythema on the anterior side of the chest on the left side and this could be related to the radiation so on your lower extremities i appreciate no edema and everything else looks good and thank you i know you did a chest x-ray before coming in so on your results for the chest x-ray it does look like you have some mild radiation pneumonitis which basically means some inflammation of the lungs most likely due to the radiation so what does this all mean so for your assessment and plan so for the first diagnosis the first problem of the lung cancer so what we're gon na do is we're gon na continue with the current regimen of your chemotherapy of the cisplacin and the etoside and we're gon na continue with your current dose of radiation at forty five grade and when that's complete we will repeat some imaging and hopefully you know the tumor will shrink down enough that we can remove it surgically okay for problem number two so the radiation pneumonitis so that's what causing that cough as well as some of the shortness of breath i know you're not experiencing it much now so what i'm gon na do for that is actually gon na prescribe you a low dose of prednisone and so that's an will help with the inflammation i'm gon na give you forty milligrams daily for five days and so hopefully that will help reduce the inflammation and so that you can continue with the radiation okay how does that sound so far
[patient] that sounds great thank you
[doctor] okay and then lastly for the painful swallowing that you're having so the inflammation you're having it not only in your lungs but it also in your esophagus as well so what i'm gon na do is prescribe you you're taking the the prednisone i'm also gon na give you a lidocaine swish and swallow and you can do that four times a day and so that will be able to help you so you can eat immediately after taking it and it can also help so that you can continue to take food and fluids prevent dehydration and any further weight loss

MEDICAL NOTE:

CHIEF COMPLAINT

History of right ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS).

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Sophia Brown is a 75 y.o. female who presents today for a new patient evaluation due to her history of right DCIS. She is doing well but wishes to establish care today for continued monitoring.

The patient underwent a screening mammogram in 10/2019 and was found to have a calcification in the right breast. She then had a right breast ultrasound on 11/03/2019 which revealed a mass at the 2 o’clock position, 11 cm from the nipple, in the retroareolar region. The report states the mass was 0.4 by 2.0 by 3.0 centimeters. She subsequently had an ultrasound-guided core needle biopsy on 12/05/2019 and pathology results revealed grade 2 ER-positive, PR-positive DCIS. The patient then had a lumpectomy with lymphadenectomy performed on 01/20/2020. The tumor was 8 mm with negative margins and the 5 lymph nodes removed were all benign. Pathology from the tumor confirmed DCIS. Her lumpectomy was followed by adjuvant radiation therapy. Endocrine therapy was also offered but the patient declined. She has since had a mammogram in 01/2021 which was normal. The patient also reports that she performs self-breast exams regularly at home.

Mrs. Brown is a G5P5 female and estimates that her last menstrual period was approximately 30 years ago. She is not currently and has never been on hormone replacement therapy.

The patient’s last colonoscopy was done in 2018. She had a sigmoid polypectomy at that time and pathology showed a tubular adenoma.

Her cholesterol was recently noted to be elevated and the patient reports that she is exercising and reducing fatty food intake accordingly. This is being followed by her primary care provider.

PHYSICAL EXAM

The ECOG performance status today is grade 0.
Breast: There are no palpable masses; however, there is some skin thickening at the medial inferior aspect of the right breast which may be radiation skin changes.

ASSESSMENT

Stage 0 ER/PR-positive invasive ductal carcinoma of the right breast.
The patient is status post lumpectomy with removal of 5 lymph nodes which were benign. She also underwent adjuvant radiation therapy but declined endocrine therapy. Today’s clinical examination shows no evidence of recurrent disease or other malignancy. She also had a negative mammogram in 01/2021.

[patient] you as well .
[doctor] so , you've come to see me today because you had a right breast lumpectomy last year . is that right ?
[patient] yes . on january 20th , 2020 .
[doctor] okay . and how have you been since then ? any problems or concerns ?
[patient] no , i'm feeling good . i do my self breast exams religiously now and have n't felt anything since .
[doctor] perfect . i want to back up and go over your history so i can make sure everything in your chart is correct and i do n't miss anything . so , i'll tell you what we have in your chart from your other providers and you tell me if anything is wrong or missing . sound good ?
[patient] sounds good .
[doctor] great . so , i have that you were found to have a calcification in your right breast during a mammogram in october 2019 . was that just a normal screening mammogram , or was it done because you felt a lump ?
[patient] it was just a normal one you're supposed to get every so often .
[doctor] i see . and then it looks like you had an ultrasound of your right breast on november 3rd , 2019 , which revealed a mass at the two o'clock position , 11 centimeters from the nipple in the retroareolar region . the report states the mass was point four by two by three centimeters .
[patient] yes , that sounds right . hard to remember now , though .
[doctor] yep , definitely .
[doctor] based on those results , they decided to do an ultrasound-guided core needle biopsy on december 5th , 2019 . pathology results during that biopsy came back as grade two , er positive , pr positive , dcis , or ductal carcinoma in situ .
[patient] yes . unfortunately .
[doctor] i know . scary stuff . but you had a lumpectomy on january 20th , 2020 , which removed the eight millimeter tumor and margins were negative . the pathology confirmed dcis . looks like they also removed 5 lymph nodes , which , thankfully , were negative for malignancy . that's great !
[patient] yeah , i was definitely very relieved .
[doctor] and your last mammogram was in january 2021 ? and that was normal .
[patient] yes .
[doctor] okay . so , i feel like i have a good grasp of what's been going on with you now . and you're here today to establish care with me so i can continue to follow you and make sure you're doing well , right ?
[patient] yes . fingers crossed .
[doctor] definitely . we'll keep a close eye on you and take good care of you .
[patient] okay , sounds good .
[doctor] i have a few more questions for you . when was your last colonoscopy ?
[patient] i had one in 2018 and , if i remember correctly , i had one polyp and that was removed and it was n't cancerous .
[doctor] okay , yes , i see that report now . one polyp in the sigmoid colon which had a benign tubular adenoma . okay . and when was your last menstrual period ?
[patient] gosh . it was probably around 30 years ago .
[doctor] okay . do you have children ?
[patient] i do . i have five .
[doctor] ah , big family then . that's nice .
[patient] yes . and they're all having kids of their own now , so it's getting even bigger .
[doctor] i bet . sounds like fun .
[patient] it is .
[doctor] did you have any other pregnancies that were miscarriages or terminations ?
[patient] really , i did not .
[doctor] okay . so for the record , that's g5 p5 . and now that you're post-menopausal , are you currently or have you ever been on hormone replacement therapy ?
[patient] my primary care doctor gave me the option years ago but i decided against it .
[doctor] okay . and on your review systems form , you indicated that you've not had any recent weight loss or gain , headaches , bone pain , urinary symptoms , or blood in the stools . but you did indicate that you have some back pain , joint pain , and high cholesterol . tell me some more about those .
[patient] okay . so i've seen doctors for all of those . they've said , excuse me , the back and knee pain are age-related . and the cholesterol is a fairly new diagnosis , but i am working on exercise and cutting back on fatty foods to see if i can get it lower without any medication .
[doctor] okay . and your primary care doctor is following you for that , right ?
[patient] that's correct .
[doctor] okay . for medications , i have that you take coq10 , vitamin d , vitamin c , fish oil , and elderberry fruit . is that all right ?
[patient] yes , and that's all .
[doctor] okay . so for your medical history , it's high cholesterol and stage 0 er/pr positive invasive ductal carcinoma of the right breast . any surgeries other than the lumpectomy ?
[patient] i did have my tubes tied after my last baby , but that's all .
[doctor] okay . and how about family history ?
[patient] my mom had non-hodgkin's lymphoma and my dad had prostate cancer and heart disease , but i think that's it .
[doctor] all right . any family history of breast cancer ?
[patient] none .
[doctor] did any of your children have medical issues or siblings with medical problems ?
[patient] i do not have any siblings and , thankfully , my children are all healthy .
[doctor] wonderful . do you have any history of smoking , illicit drug use , heavy alcohol consumption ?
[patient] no drugs . i do drink socially , but never more than that . and i used to smoke , but really , everybody did back then and i probably quit about 30 years ago .
[doctor] excellent . i have that you're allergic to penicillin . any other allergies ?
[patient] nope , just penicillin .
[doctor] okay . i think that covers it . hop up here and let me take a look at you .
[doctor] okay , so let's use the normal new patient exam template . only change to make is the breast exam . there are no palpable masses , however , there is skin thickening at the medial inferior aspect of the right breast which may be radiation skin changes .
[doctor] in the result section , note that her ecog performance status today is zero .
[doctor] do you have ... did you have radiation after the lumpectomy ?
[patient] i did . we also talked about endocrine therapy , but i decided against that .
[doctor] okay . so your exam looks good , no masses , just some skin changes from that radiation . now , let's go over the plan for you .
[patient] okay , sounds good .
[doctor] as you know , you've had dcis which we'll list in my note as stage zero , er/pr positive , invasive ductal carcinoma of the right breast . your status post-lumpectomy with removal of five lymph nodes that were benign . you also had , um , radiation therapy but declined endocrine therapy . today's clinical examination shows no evidence of recurrence with the dcis or other malignancy and your mammogram in january , 2021 was also negative for recurrence and malignancy .
[doctor] so , based on all of that , we can just continue to observe you .
[patient] okay . that sounds great . and when do i come back in to see you ?
[doctor] in a year , but you should have another mammogram in april of 2022 before you come back to see me .
[patient] okay , i can do that .
[doctor] wonderful . i'm glad to see you doing so well . do you have any questions or concerns i can address for you today ?
[patient] i do n't think so .

MEDICAL NOTE:

CHIEF COMPLAINT

Right elbow pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Lawrence Butler is a pleasant 45-year-old male who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of right elbow pain.

Over the past week, the patient has developed 6/10 pain in the ""inside"" of his right elbow. The pain may radiate into his forearm on occasion, but does not extend up to his shoulder. He denies any history of trauma or injury, but he did start making pottery during the COVID-19 pandemic and suspects that his symptoms could be related to that. His symptoms affect his ability to lift objects or perform his typical activities of daily living. Ibuprofen provides minimal symptomatic relief.

SOCIAL HISTORY

The patient reports that he began making pottery during the COVID-19 pandemic.

MEDICATIONS

The patient reports that he has been taking ibuprofen.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Musculoskeletal: Reports right elbow pain.

VITALS

Normal

PHYSICAL EXAM

MSK: Examination of the right elbow: Moderate tenderness at the medial epicondyle. No pain with supination of the forearm. Pain with pronation of the forearm. Pain with resistance against flexion of the wrist.

RESULTS

X-ray imaging of the right elbow was obtained and reviewed in office today. These reveal no evidence of fracture or bony abnormality.

ASSESSMENT

Right medial epicondylitis.

PLAN

The patient and I discussed his diagnosis in detail, and I explained that his symptoms are likely caused by overuse and potential damage of the tendons. We will provide him with sling to be worn during the day while he is awake. I want him to take ibuprofen 600 mg every 6 hours with food for a full week and ice the elbow for 20 minutes, 3 times daily. Finally, I advised the patient to rest his elbow and avoid doing any pottery for the next couple of weeks.

INSTRUCTIONS

The patient will follow up in 1 week.

---------------------------------------------","[doctor] hey lawrence how're you doing
[patient] i'm doing alright aside from this elbow pain

[patient] you know it hurts a lot in the inside of my elbow
[doctor] okay so the inside of your right elbow okay
[patient] yeah
[doctor] and then does the pain radiate down your arm or up into your shoulder or anything like that
[patient] it does n't go into my shoulder it's it stays mostly at my elbow but it can go down a bit into my forearm
[doctor] okay and then do you remember any trauma did you hit your arm or elbow or any on anything

[doctor] okay and does that pain keep you up at night
[patient] it does
[doctor] okay and when you have that kind of pain does it keep you from doing other type of activities
[patient] yeah i mean i still try to like work through with using my arm but yeah it's it's it's difficult for me sometimes to lift and do things because of that pain
[doctor] okay and then and how long has this pain been going on
[patient] about four days now
[doctor] alright and anything you've done to help relieve or alleviate that pain any anything that that's giving you relief
[patient] i've tried ibuprofen that helps a little but not much
[doctor] okay so if it's okay with you i would like to do a a quick physical exam your vitals look good and i'm gon na do a focused exam on that right elbow i'm gon na go ahead and and and press here do you do you have any pain when i press here

[doctor] okay so have you noticed any nausea chills fever
[patient] no fever some chills and i i just in so much pain i i ca n't eat and i do feel a little nauseous
[doctor] okay that sound definitely understandable so you've been in a lot of pain so have you tried to take any medications to alleviate the pain
[patient] yeah i've been taking tylenol i have had to try some ibuprofen i know you said to be careful with my blood pressure but i have been trying to do that because i'm just in so much pain and it's not really working
[doctor] okay and before what would you how long would you say it took you to pass the other stones or how was that that resolved
[patient] yeah usually usually about about three four days to pass it yeah
[doctor] right so this is this is the looks like this is the third day
[patient] yeah
[doctor] so we are getting close there
[patient] okay
[doctor] yeah so hopefully we can pass it but we'll i'll definitely we can take a look at it here in a second so while you are here i also wanted to check up on your your diabetes and and hypertension you have so i'm looking here at my notes and you're on two . five of norvasc for your high blood pressure when you came in today your blood pressure was a was a little bit high and i know that's probably because you are in a bunch of pain so that definitely makes sense but i think last time we talked a little bit about you getting a blood pressure cuff and taking your blood pressures regularly so those readings first off were you able to get the blood pressure cuff
[patient] i was i have n't been great about taking it but i did get the blood pressure cuff
[doctor] so the time that you did take it and i think that's something we got to work on is you've taken them i think at least three times a week i would like you to what have those been running
[patient] like the top numbers they're usually the one thirties sometimes i get i do go into one forties and once it went to like one fifty
[doctor] okay
[patient] and then the bottom number has been between seventy and eighty okay that i mean that's not too bad i think when you were first diagnosed you were up there in the
[doctor] the one eighties which was really high
[patient] right
[doctor] so let me talk a little bit also about you trying to lower your salt intake to like like twenty three hundred milligrams a a day so have you been able to do that
[patient] trying my best but doc i really like my french fries
[doctor] yeah
[patient] like
[doctor] we we all like we all like the french fries you know but you know we we we we also do n't like strokes so we do n't want to have a scope and all the all the french fries so that's something definitely i would like you to work on and do you think you'd be able to to curb that french fry habit or that bad this bad food habits by yourself or do you think you need help
[patient] yeah some help could be helpful okay yeah we can definitely get you connected with someone just to help you with your diet kinda that's the biggest thing for a lot of my patient is trying to control that diet alright
[doctor] so i also want to take a look here at your diabetes and last time you came in your a1c was a little bit higher at seven . three and you're on five hundred of metformin currently so have you been taking your blood sugars before you eat everyday
[patient] i have and those those have been pretty good they are like in the low one hundreds
[doctor] okay that that that's definitely good because when you came in i think we did a glucose test on you couple of months ago and you were around three hundred which is which is pretty up there so i'm glad that you know those levels are down and have you been taking that metformin everyday
[patient] i do
[doctor] okay
[patient] i do take it
[doctor] that that that that's really good alright so let me do a quick physical exam on you just a couple of questions before i take a look at your your abdomen and and your back talked to take a look at that that kidney stones you're having so i just want to make sure are you having any any chest pain
[patient] no chest pain
[doctor] no chest pain are you having any belly pain
[patient] the back pain is starting to kind of go down into my groin but i would n't say any back pain i mean abdominal pain
[doctor] no abdominal pain alright so let me check here i'm gon na listen to your heart real quick and so on your heart exam i do hear a grade two out of six systolic ejection murmur and that we knew about that already so not really worried about that currently listen to your lungs your lungs are clear bilaterally i do n't hear any crackles or wheezes so let me press here on your abdomen does that hurt
[patient] yes
[doctor] okay i'm gon na press here on your back is that painful
[patient] yes
[doctor] alright so on your examination of your abdomen there is tenderness to palpation of the abdomen there is n't any rebound or guarding though and only there is also cva tinnitus on the right on your on your flank as well and so it seems to me you know that you do have that kidney stone looks like you do have some inflammation around your kidney that's what that that's that tenderness around your cva is is telling me so let's go talk a little bit about my assessment and plan for you so you know right now because of your history of of having kidney stones you you do have a kidney stone so what we're gon na do is first off i'm gon na get you some pain medication kinda you're in a ton of pain right now i'm gon na prescribe you some oxycodone five milligrams you can take that every six to eight hours as needed for pain and so hopefully that can help you feeling better and you can continue to take that tylenol for any breakthrough pain that you're having i do wan na make sure that you're pushing fluids right now because we need to try to push that stone out that you're having just kinda clear your kidneys and that that would definitely help i also want to give you a strainer so you can strain your urine to see if you do actually pass that stone and then i'm going to refer you to urology and we're actually i'm gon na have you you even if you pass a stone in the next couple of days i want you to go anyway because it seems like you're having recurrent kidney stones and so hopefully they can help do something to to help this from happening in the future for your hypertension i'm gon na keep you on that two . five norvasc your your blood pressures look good so i'm not gon na make any changes there and then for your diabetes we'll keep you on the five hundred of metformin and i also want to give you a referral to nutrition to a dietitian and they will be able to help you with your your diet i know you said you have a few issues so you know they can possibly write a diet for you and if you follow it you know hopefully in the future we can get you off of both of these medications and get you back to normal so how does that all sound
[patient] that sounds good and i i just i just want this pain to go away so thank you

MEDICAL NOTE:

CHIEF COMPLAINT

Iron deficiency anemia.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Mrs. Christina Cooper is a 65-year-old female who presents with a long-history of iron deficiency anemia.

The patient reports she has been living with anemia since she was 13 years old. She attempted to donate blood on 12/2019 but was unable to due to her anemia. She has a history of heavy menstruation and a hysterectomy in 1996. She completed a colonoscopy 5-6 years ago with nonsignificant findings. She denies having a pacemaker, defibrillator, sleep apnea, or using oxygen.

Mrs. Cooper reports a myriad of symptoms, stating she feels fatigued often during the day, feverish with chills at times, and during activity feels she cannot catch her breath and some wheezing is present. She has been having some headaches which is uncommon for her. Additionally, she is noticing tingling sensations, cold sensitivity, and her anxiety and depression have worsened.

PAST HISTORY

Surgical
Hysterectomy, 1996.

Procedures
Colonoscopy 5-6 years ago.

SOCIAL HISTORY

Drink’s alcohol 1-2 times per year.

CURRENT MEDICATIONS

Ferrous Sulfate 25 mg tablet twice per day (1 in the morning, 1 in the evening), Vitamin B12 OTC.

PHYSICAL EXAM

Gastrointestinal
Abdomen non-tender.

ASSESSMENT

• Iron deficiency anemia

Mrs. Cooper is a 65-year-old female who was diagnosed with iron deficiency anemia in 12/2019 and was unable to donate blood. Her follow-up blood work in 01/2020 revealed a low hemoglobin, stable hematocrit, and normal iron labs, although, ferritin was low. She has been taking ferrous sulfate 325 mg by mouth.

PLAN

I have asked her to continue each ferrous sulfate dose with vitamin C found in orange juice for the next 12 weeks then recheck CBC, iron ferritin, B-12, and folate. A referral was sent for her to see a hematologist. We will plan for EGD and colonoscopy to assess for potential sources of anemia or GI bleed. If this is inconclusive, capsule endoscopy can be considered.

INSTRUCTIONS

Schedule upper endoscopy, colonoscopy and appointment with hematologist. Return to the clinic if symptoms worsen.

---------------------------------------------","[doctor] today i'm seeing christina cooper . her date of birth is 07/01/1954 . uh , ms. cooper is a new patient who was referred by diane nelson for a long-standing iron deficiency anemia .
[doctor] hello , how are you ?
[patient] i'm good , thank you .
[doctor] so tell me what brings you in today .
[patient] recently i tried to donate blood , around december i think , and they told me i was anemic , which is something i've been dealing with for a while , so it's not the first time i've been told i'm anemic .
[doctor] or how have you been feeling in general with this ?
[patient] not great . i have been feeling fatigued often during the day , and even feverish with chills at times . when i try to be active i like i ca n't catch my breath and i feel like i'm wheezing . i've had some headaches too , which is not like me .
[doctor] okay . are there any other symptoms ?
[patient] i've been noting some chilling sensations . i also get cold so easily . it's annoying . i feel like i have to really bundle up . i do n't know if this is related but my anxiety and depression feel like it has been getting worse lately . i feel like a mess .
[doctor] sounds like you're not feeling great , obviously . and i'm glad you came to see us . um , we're certainly going to try to figure this out and figure out what's going on , uh , but it sounds like you've been dealing with this anemia for a long time ?
[patient] yeah , i've been anemic since i was 13 years old .
[doctor] right . so why do your doctors think you're anemic ? do you have a history of heavy periods ?
[patient] well i did have heavy periods until i had a hysterectomy in 1996 . but no , they have not told me why they think i'm anemic , which is frustrating honestly .
[doctor] yeah . i can imagine that is . um , let's see if we can help though . since you had your hysterectomy your periods , of course , are no longer the issue . um , when was your last colonoscopy ?
[patient] about five to six years ago .
[doctor] and was it relatively a normal exam ? did you have any polyps ?
[patient] no . they said they'd see me in 10 years .
[doctor] well that's good news .
[patient] yeah , i agree .
[doctor] um , do you have a pacemaker or defibrillator , or have sleep apnea , or use oxygen at night ?
[patient] no .
[doctor] all right . do you ever drink alcohol ?
[patient] yeah , but only once or twice a year .
[doctor] okay . are you taking any supplements such as iron or vitamin b12 ?
[patient] i already started taking my iron pills which i have not taken in about a year .
[doctor] all right . and what are you taking ?
[patient] i'm taking 25 milligram tablets , twice daily .
[doctor] okay , and that's the , the ferrous sulfate ?
[patient] yeah , that's it . i take one in the morning and one in the evening .
[doctor] okay . anything else ?
[patient] yeah , i take vitamin b12 , just the over the counter stuff .
[doctor] okay , very good . all right , well let's go ahead and take a look and see what's going on .
[patient] sounds good . thank you .
[doctor] of course . you'll hear me , uh , talk through your exam so that i get all the information documented .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] all right . so use my general physical exam template . i will start by listening to your heart and lungs .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] all right . next , i'd like you to lay back so i can examine your abdomen .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] is there any tenderness where i'm pressing ?
[patient] no .
[doctor] okay . you can sit up . so your physical exam is normal without any significant findings . all right ms. cooper , often when we initially see anemia and your host of symptoms , we suspect internal bleeding .
[patient] is that why they want me to have another upper endoscopy ?
[doctor] actually it would be an upper endoscopy and a colonoscopy , but yes , likely that's the reason why .
[patient] lovely .
[doctor] yeah . unfortunately our cameras do not meet all the way in the middle , so if those tests back , come , if those tests come back fine , then we'll have you swallow a pill camera to take pictures as it moves through your , uh , system .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] we may not need to , but it's just the first thing we can do to make sure that you're not losing blood . um , the second thing we can do is have you see a hematologist . they will tell us if you need to give any , to give you any intravenous iron , or maybe something to help your body store the iron better .
[patient] all right .
[doctor] so let's go ahead , get your upper endoscopy and colonoscopy scheduled .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] um , have you ever had any issue with sedation in the past ?
[patient] no , i was just sleepy afterwards .
[doctor] okay . well we will give you a bowel prep to clean out your bowels ahead of time . um , if we do these tests and they are normal , like i said , then we will consider that capsule endoscopy .
[patient] okay . sounds like a plan .
[doctor] all right . so after that you'll be all done and we will send you to the hematologist . additionally , i'm going to need you to start taking your iron pills with orange juice . uh , the vitamin c will help you absorb the iron better . do this for about 8-12 weeks , uh , and then we can reassess your blood work .
[patient] okay , that sounds great .
[doctor] all right . well i think we have our plan . on your way out , stop by and schedule your upper endoscopy and c- colonoscopy . uh , we will send a referral to dr. flores who is is the hematologist , so schedule that appointment . um , here are your instructions for the pre- uh , the bowel prep . uh , call us if you have any questions or worsening symptoms . we'll be happy to help you .
[patient] thank you .
[doctor] you're welcome . have a great day , have a great day ms. cooper .
[patient] you too .
[doctor] all right . this is christina cooper , pleasant 65 year old female who was diagnosed with iron deficiency anemia in 12-2019 , and w- and was unable to donate blood . um , her followup blood work on 01/20/20 was revealed a low hemoglobin , stable hematocrit and normal iron labs , although ferritin was low . um , she was taking ferrous sulfate , three hundred , twenty phil- 25 milligrams by mouth . i've asked her to continue each dose with vitamin c found in orange juice , for the next 12 weeks , then recheck to the cbc , iron , ferritin , b12 , and folate . um , a referral was sent to her hematologist . we will plan for an egd and a colonoscopy to assess for potential sources of anemia or gi bleed . if this is inconclusive , capsule endoscopy will be considered . thanks .",2609.5,"Ferrous Sulfate 25 mg tablet twice per day (1 in the morning, 1 in the evening), Vitamin B12 OTC.",sonnet_result,"According to the transcript, the patient is currently taking:

MEDICAL NOTE:

CHIEF COMPLAINT

Tick bite.

MEDICAL HISTORY

Patient reports a history of arthritis, hypertension, and diabetes type 2.

SOCIAL HISTORY

Patient reports he enjoys spending time outside in the woods and working in the yard. He went hunting with his grandchildren a couple of weeks ago.

MEDICATIONS

Patient reports taking lisinopril 20 mg once a day and metformin 1000 mg twice daily most of the time.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Constitutional: Reports general ill feelings. Denies any fever, chills, flu like symptoms, body aches, or trouble waking.
Respiratory: Denies cough or shortness of breath.
Musculoskeletal: Denies joint pain or problems with ambulation.
Skin: Reports warmth on the right knee.
Neurological: Reports headache. Denies dizziness.

VITALS

Blood Pressure: 122/70 mmHg.
Heart Rate: 67 beats per minute.
Body Temperature: 98.4 degrees F.

PHYSICAL EXAM

Neck
- General Examination: Neck is supple without thyromegaly or lymphadenopathy.

Respiratory
- Auscultation of Lungs: Clear bilaterally.

Cardiovascular
- Auscultation of Heart: Regular rate and rhythm. No murmurs, gallops or rubs.

Musculoskeletal
- Examination of the right knee: Erythema and edema as well as an area of fluctuance noted over the right patella. There is pain to palpation of the right anterior knee. Full range of motion.

Integumentary
- Examination: There is evidence of a bull’s eye rash over the right knee.

RESULTS

Patient's previous kidney function is within normal limits.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

1. Tick bite.
- Medical Reasoning: My concern is that he might have Lyme disease based on the presentation of his right knee.
- Patient Education and Counseling: The patient and I discussed blood testing to determine if he does in fact have Lyme disease. I explained that Lyme disease can cause problems with other organs if not treated appropriately. We discussed that sometimes antibiotics need to be administered intravenously if oral antibiotics are not given early enough. We will see how he does with a course of oral antibiotics as I would like to avoid intravenous antibiotics.
- Medical Treatment: Prescription for doxycycline 100 mg twice a day for 3 weeks provided. Lyme titer and Western blot will be obtained to determine if he has Lyme disease.

2. Hypertension.
- Medical Reasoning: This is well-controlled at this time.
- Patient Education and Counseling: The patient and I discussed that he is doing really well monitoring his blood pressure at home.
- Medical Treatment: Continue lisinopril 20 mg once a day. Lipid panel ordered to assess his cholesterol levels.

3. Diabetes type 2.
- Medical Reasoning: He is doing a good job managing his diabetes since his blood sugars are running in the 120s. I do not think we need to make any adjustments, but we will see what the hemoglobin A1c shows as that gives us an idea of what his blood sugars are doing on a long-term basis.
- Patient Education and Counseling: We discussed that metformin can affect kidney function; however, his kidney function was last checked 2 months ago, and it has remained within normal limits.
- Medical Treatment: Continue metformin 1000 mg twice a day. Hemoglobin A1c ordered. Basic metabolic panel ordered to assess kidney function. 

Patient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.

[patient] it's it's probably with with with the metformin it seems to be you know one twenty
[doctor] good
[patient] pretty regular
[doctor] good your blood sugars are running in the one twenties that's really good okay alright well i wan na just go ahead and do a quick physical exam okay so i'm looking here at your vital signs and your vital signs look really good i do think you're doing a good job with taking your lisinopril your blood pressure's about one twenty two over seventy right now which is right where we want it your heart rate is nice and slow at sixty seven again which is right where we want it and i do n't appreciate any fever today you you have a normal temperature at ninety eight . four which is really good so i'm just gon na be going ahead and calling out some physical exam findings and i'm gon na let you know what that means when i'm done okay so on your heart exam your heart is in a nice regular rate and rhythm i do n't appreciate any murmur rub or gallop on your lung exam your lungs are nice and clear to auscultation bilaterally on your right knee exam i do appreciate some erythema and edema as well as an area of fluctuance over your right patella now does it hurt when i press
[patient] it's a little bit sore
[doctor] okay there is pain to palpation of the right anterior knee and i'm just gon na bend your knee up and down does that hurt at all
[patient] no no it's just more of the typical grinding that i would feel
[doctor] okay there is full range of motion of the right knee and on skin examination there is evidence of a bull's-eye rash over the right knee okay so what does that mean richard so that means that you know you do have some area of some inflammation over the over the right knee where you where you have that tick bite and you do have what we call that bull's eye rash which is what we get concerned about with with lyme disease so let's just talk a little bit about you know my assessment and my plan for you okay so for this first problem of your of your tick bite my concern is that you might have lyme disease based on the presentation of your right knee so i'm gon na go ahead and start you on doxycycline one hundred milligrams twice a day
[patient] we're gon na continue that for about three weeks i'm also gon na go ahead and send a lyme titer as well as a western blot to see if you do in fact have lyme lyme disease and we'll have to go ahead and just see how you do with this we you know i'd like to avoid intravenous antibiotics which i think we can avoid but i wanted to see how you do so
[doctor] do you have any questions about that
[patient] yeah i did n't know what those last two things or just
[doctor] yeah so so we are gon na start you on some antibiotics to help help you with this
[patient] you know possible lyme disease and i'm gon na just order some blood tests just to see exactly what's going on and then you know sometimes people need intravenous antibiotics because lyme disease can cause problems on other organs like your heart that type of thing
[doctor] if not treated appropriately and sometimes we need to give antibiotics through the iv which i'd like to avoid i think that we got this early enough that we can just treat you with some oral antibiotics okay for your second problem of your hypertension you know i think you're doing a really good job let's go ahead and continue you on the lisinopril twenty milligrams once a day and i wan na just go ahead and order a lipid panel just to make sure that everything is okay with your cholesterol how does that sound
[patient] that's fine
[doctor] great and then for your third problem of your diabetes i wan na just go ahead and order a hemoglobin a1c and continue you on the metformin one thousand milligrams twice a day it sounds like you're doing a good job since your blood sugars are running in the one twenties i do n't think we need to make any adjustments but we'll see what the hemoglobin a1c shows that gives us a an idea of what your blood sugars are doing on a long-term basis how does that sound
[patient] okay at what point time do you start kinda checking kidney function i've been told that metformin can possibly cause some kidney issues
[doctor] so it can you know your kidney function we've you know i think you've been really lucky it's been normal i checked it about two months ago and it looks pretty good it looks pretty normal but since we're doing blood work on you i can go ahead and order a a basic metabolic panel just to make sure that your kidney function is stable
[patient] okay that'd be good
[doctor] okay anything else
[patient] not that i can think of at this time as soon as i leave
[doctor] well you know where to find me okay
[patient] alright

MEDICAL NOTE:

CHIEF COMPLAINT

Right-sided abdominal pain

MEDICAL HISTORY

Patient reports history of kidney stones.

FAMILY HISTORY

Patient reports his father has a history of kidney stones.

MEDICATIONS

Patient reports use of Tylenol.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Gastrointestinal: Reports right-sided abdominal pain and nausea. Denies vomiting
Genitourinary: Reports dysuria and dark colored urine. Denies hematuria.

PHYSICAL EXAM

Gastrointestinal
- Examination of Abdomen: No masses or tenderness to palpation. No rebound or guarding. No peritoneal signs. Positive CVA tenderness on the right flank.

RESULTS

Previous CT scan of the abdomen ordered by the patient's PCP is reviewed and demonstrates a 0.5 cm kidney stone located in the proximal right ureter. There is no evidence of hydronephrosis.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

1. Acute nephrolithiasis.
- Medical Reasoning: The patient presents with complaints of right-sided abdominal pain. His previous CT scan was reviewed and demonstrates a 0.5 cm kidney stone located in the proximal right ureter without evidence of hydronephrosis.
- Medical Treatment: I have recommended that he push fluids in order to help facilitate urination to help pass the stone. He will be provided with a strainer to allow us to potentially test the stone if he is able to pass it. I have also prescribed oxycodone 5 mg every 6 to 8 hours as needed for pain. He can continue to alternate oxycodone with Tylenol. A basic metabolic panel, urinalysis, and urine culture will also be ordered.

INSTRUCTIONS

He will follow up in 1 to 2 weeks. If he is still having symptoms at that time, we will discuss further treatment such as lithotripsy or ureteroscopy. He is to contact me if he is having worsening symptoms over the next week.

[doctor] i saw my doctor and they ordered a cat scan and said i had a kidney stone and sent me to see a urologist okay well does the pain move or or or go anywhere or does it stay right in that same spot yeah it feels like it goes to my lower abdomen in into my groin okay and is the pain constant or does it come and go it comes and goes when it comes it's it's pretty it's pretty bad i feel like i ca n't find a comfortable position okay and do you notice any any pain when you urinate or when you pee
[patient] yeah it kinda burns a little bit
[doctor] okay do you notice any blood i do n't think there is any you know frank blood but the urine looks a little dark sometimes okay and what have you taken for the pain i have taken some tylenol but it has n't really helped okay and do you have any nausea vomiting any fever chills i feel nauseated but i'm not vomiting okay is anyone in your in your family had kidney stones yes my father had them and have you had kidney stones before yeah so i i've i've had them but i've been able to pass them but this is taking a lot longer okay well i'm just gon na go ahead and do a physical examination i'm gon na be calling out some of my exam findings and i'm going to explain what what those mean when i'm done okay
[patient] okay
[doctor] okay so on physical examination of the abdomen on a abdominal exam there is no tenderness to palpation there is no evidence of any rebound or guarding there is no peritoneal signs there is positive cva tenderness on the right flank so essentially what that means russell is that you know you have some tenderness over your over your right kidney and that just means that you might have some inflammation there so i i reviewed the results of the ct scan of your abdomen that the primary care doctor ordered and it does show a . five centimeter kidney stone located in the proximal right ureter so this the ureter is the duct in which urine passes between the kidney and the bladder there's no evidence of what we call hydronephrosis this means you know swelling of the kidney which is good means that things are still able to get through so let's talk a little bit about my assessment and my plan okay so for your first problem of this acute nephrolithiasis or kidney stone i i wan na go ahead and recommend that you push fluids to help facilitate urination and peeing to help pass the stone i'm going to prescribe oxycodone five milligrams every six to eight hours as needed for pain you can continue to alternate that with some tylenol i'm going to give you a strainer that you can use to strain your urine so that we can see it see the stone when it passes and we can send it for some some tests if that happens i'm also gon na order what we call a basic metabolic panel a urinalysis and a urine culture now i wan na see you again in one to two weeks and if you're still having symptoms we'll have to discuss further treatment such as lithotripsy which is essentially a shock wave procedure in which we sedate you and use shock waves to break up the stone to help it pass we could also do what we call a ureteroscopy which is a small telescope small camera used to go up to to the urethra and bladder and up into the ureter to retrieve the stone so let's see how you do over the next week and i want you to contact me if you're having worsening symptoms okay okay sounds good thank you",911.0,Patient reports use of Tylenol.,sonnet_result,"According to the transcript, the patient mentions taking Tylenol for the pain, but it hasn't really helped.",1.0,Bin 1

MEDICAL NOTE:

CHIEF COMPLAINT

Left knee pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Andrea Barnes is a 34-year-old female who presents today for evaluation of left knee pain.

The patient has been experiencing intermittent episodes of pain and sudden instability with ambulation. Her pain is localized deep in her patella and occurs less than once daily. Due to the fleeting nature of these episodes, she has not taken medication and simply braces herself until it passes. She denies any trauma or injury, or ever hearing or feeling a pop in the knee. Her symptoms do not interfere with her daily activities and she does not use a cane.

Regarding her hypertension, it has been several days since she last checked her blood pressure at home, but it was approximately 120/70 mmHg at that time. Her current medications include amlodipine, lisinopril, and hydrochlorothiazide, all of which she takes on a regular basis.

In terms of her diabetes, her fasting morning blood glucose levels have been approximately 130 based on home monitoring. This is slightly higher than usual, even though she has been compliant with metformin and Farxiga. She does try to avoid eating late at night.

MEDICAL HISTORY

Patient reports a personal history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes.

SOCIAL HISTORY

Patient likes to travel and is planning a trip to Columbus, Georgia in the next month or so. She is part of the Lion's Club.

MEDICATIONS

Patient reports that she is taking amlodipine, lisinopril 20 mg once daily, hydrochlorothiazide, Metformin, and Farxiga.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Musculoskeletal: Reports left knee pain and instability,

VITALS

Temperature: 98.2 degrees F
Heart rate: 72 bpm
Respirations: 16
Blood pressure: 122/70 mmHg

PHYSICAL EXAM

MSK: Examination of the right knee: No ecchymosis or edema. No effusion. No pain with palpation.
Examination of the left knee: Full range of motion. Negative varus and valgus stress test.

RESULTS

X-rays were obtained and reviewed today. These reveal no evidence of fracture or bony abnormality.

ASSESSMENT

1. Left knee pain.
2. Hypertension.
3. Diabetes mellitus type 2.

PLAN

After reviewing the patients x-rays, I believe there is some arthritis in the knee. I'm going to prescribe meloxicam 15 mg once daily. We can consider physical therapy to strengthen the muscles around the area to prevent any further issues.

Her hypertension is well controlled with her current medication regimen. She can continue with lisinopril 20 mg once daily. I'm also going to order an echocardiogram for further evaluation of the murmur heard on exam.

She has been compliant with metformin as prescribed, but her blood glucose levels have been slightly elevated recently. I'm going to order a lipid panel, as well as a hemoglobin A1c to determine if any adjustments need to be made to her dose of metformin.

---------------------------------------------","[doctor] okay hi andrea well i
[patient] hello
[doctor] i understand you're you've come in with some right knee pain can you tell me about it what's going on

[doctor] is that in the morning when you're fasting
[patient] yes
[doctor] okay
[patient] and i have been told that sometimes the morning blood sugars are higher for some reason but i do n't know i i do n't really worry about it as long as it does n't get up too extremely high so
[doctor] and are you taking your metformin
[patient] yes yes that's along with the blood pressure medicine morning and night
[doctor] okay alright so are you are you eating like late at night or anything like that

[doctor] okay so no decreased range of motion negative varus and valgus test okay and so with your x-rays i reviewed the result of your left knee x-ray which showed no evidence of fracture or bony abnormality so lem me tell you a little bit about my plan so your left knee pain i think you just have some arthritis in that i want to prescribe some meloxicam fifteen milligrams a day we might do some physical therapy for that just to strengthen the muscles around that area and prevent any further problems with that okay and so for your second problem the hypertension so i wan na continue the lisinopril at twenty milligrams a day and order an echocardiogram just to evaluate that heart murmur alright and
[patient] okay
[doctor] for the diabetes mellitus i wan na order a hemoglobin a1c to see if we need to make any adjustments to your metformin and i'm also gon na order a lipid panel okay do you have any questions

[patient] right here .
[doctor] all right . and anything make it better or worse ?
[patient] i have been putting ice on it , uh , and i've been taking ibuprofen , but it does n't seem to help much .
[doctor] okay . so it sounds like you fell a couple days ago , and you've hurt something inside of your right knee .
[patient] mm-hmm .
[doctor] and you've been taking a little bit of ice , uh , putting some ice on it , and has n't really helped and some ibuprofen . is that right ?

[doctor] all right . um , let's do your exam , okay ? so is it tender ... where is it mostly tender right now ?
[patient] right on the inside of my knee . right here .
[doctor] all right , so if i bend your knee forward , does that seem to hurt ?
[patient] yes , that hurts .
[doctor] all right , how about if i twist it a little bit that way .

[doctor] okay , okay . and how about down here ? do you feel me touch you down here ?
[patient] yes .
[doctor] all right . any other pain down here in your calves ?

CHIEF COMPLAINT

Left foot pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Jean Martinez is a pleasant 27-year-old female who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of left foot pain.

The patient sustained an injury to her left foot while playing soccer yesterday. She became entangled with another player, causing the player to fall onto the patient's foot, resulting in immediate pain. After the incident, she required help to get off of the field and was unable to participate for the rest of the game. Her trainer wrapped her foot, and she has tried ice, elevation, and ibuprofen to treat her symptoms. with medication, she rates her pain as 3/10, but without medication her pain is rated as 7-8/10. There is no numbness, tingling, or other abnormal sensations associated with her pain.

Of note, the patient has sustained several injuries in the past while playing soccer, but this is her first left foot injury.

MEDICAL HISTORY

The patient reports that she has sustained several soccer injuries in the past.

SOCIAL HISTORY

The patient has been playing soccer since she was 4 or 5 years old. She is currently playing in a local league.

MEDICATIONS

The patient reports that she has been taking ibuprofen.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Musculoskeletal: Reports left foot pain.
Neurological: Denies left foot numbness or tingling.

VITALS

Blood pressure: 118/72 mmHg
Heart rate: 58 bpm
Respiratory rate: 14
Temperature: Afebrile
Oxygen saturation: 99% on room air

PHYSICAL EXAM

CV: Regular rate and rhythm without clicks, rubs, or murmurs. No ectopic beats noted on auscultation of the heart. Brisk capillary refill, less than 3 seconds. Dorsalis pedis pulse is intact and strong.
RESPIRATORY: Lungs are clear and equal bilaterally.
NEURO: Motor and sensation in the left foot are intact to light touch.
MSK: Examination of the left foot: Ecchymosis on the plantar and dorsal aspects of the foot. Associated swelling. Tenderness to palpation of the midfoot. Positive piano key test.

RESULTS

X-ray images of the left foot were obtained and reviewed today. These reveal subtle dorsal displacement of the base of the 2nd metatarsal with a 3 mm separation of the 1st and 2nd metatarsal bases. There is presence of a bony fragment in the Lisfranc joint space.

ASSESSMENT

Lisfranc fracture, left foot.

PLAN

I explained the nature of her injury in detail. Based on her exam and x-ray findings, she will most likely require surgery of the left foot, but I want to order an MRI to assess for any ligamentous injuries. We discussed the procedure and postoperative expectations, such as recovery time and restrictions, at length. We also discussed the complications associated with deferring surgical intervention including poor bone and ligament healing, pes planus deformation, and a high likelihood of developing arthritis in the foot. She will be unable to participate for the remainder of the soccer season, but should be able to play next season.

INSTRUCTIONS

We will see the patient on Monday, for surgery.

---------------------------------------------","[doctor] hey jean how're you doing today
[patient] i'm doing alright aside from this foot pain that i have
[doctor] so i see here that you looks like you hurt your left foot here where you were playing soccer can you tell me a little bit more about what happened
[patient] yeah so yeah i was playing in a soccer game yesterday and i was trying to steal the ball from another player and she ended up falling directly onto my right foot and i do n't know i i mean i was trying to get around her and my body ended up twisting around her and then i accidentally felt a pain in my foot
[doctor] okay so have you ever hurt your left foot before
[patient] no i've had a lot of injuries in soccer but never injured this foot
[doctor] okay and then so after the fall and the entanglement with the other player were you able to continue playing
[patient] no i had to stop playing right away and actually being helped off the field
[doctor] wow okay and what have you been doing for the the pain since then
[patient] so i've been keeping it elevated icing it the trainer wrapped it yesterday and taking ibuprofen as well
[doctor] okay alright so without any ibuprofen can you tell me what your pain level is
[patient] without ibuprofen i would say my pain is a three
[doctor] okay and then with your ibuprofen can you tell me what your pain level is
[patient] like a seven eight
[doctor] okay so how long have you been playing soccer
[patient] really since i was like four five i've been playing a long time
[doctor] well that's cool yeah we our our youngest daughter she is almost sixteen and she plays the inner marrial soccer league they are down at the rex center did is that where you started playing or did you guys did you start playing somewhere else
[patient] yeah just like this local town leak i started playing that way and then played all throughout school
[doctor] that's
[patient] high school teams
[doctor] that's awesome so just out of curiosity with the left foot have you experienced anything like numbness or tingling or or any strange sensation
[patient] no i have not
[doctor] okay now if it's okay with you i would like to do a quick physical exam i reviewed your vitals and everything looks good blood pressure was one eighteen over seventy two heart rate was fifty eight respiratory rate was fourteen you are afebrile and you had an o2 saturation of ninety nine percent on room air on your heart exam your regular of rate and rhythm do n't appreciate any clicks rubs or murmurs no ectopic beats noted there on auscultation listening to your lungs lungs are clear and equal bilaterally so you're moving good air i'd like to do a focused foot exam on your left foot so i do see some bruising on the bottom of your foot and on the top of your foot as well now there is associated swelling and i do appreciate tenderness to palpation of your midfoot and you are positive for the piano key test on a neurovascular exam of your left foot you have a brisk capillary refill of less than three seconds dorsalis pedis pulse is intact and strong and you do have motor and sensation that it's intact to light touch now i would like to do a review of the diagnostic imaging that you had before you came in so i do notice a subtle dorsal displacement of the base of the second metatarsal with a three millimeter separation of the first and second metatarsal bases and the presence of a bony fragment in the lisfranc joint space so lem me talk to you a little bit about my assessment and plan now for for the first concern of right foot pain your right foot pain is due to a lisfranc fracture which is a fracture to one of your second metatarsal bones at the top of your foot where the metatarsals meet your cuboids now there are ligaments at the top of your foot so i'm gon na be ordering an mri to assess for injury to any of these ligaments now based on your exam and from what i'm seeing on your x-ray you're most likely going to need surgery of that foot now the surgery will place the bones back in their proper position and using plates and screws will hold them there while they heal and this is gon na allow those bones and ligaments to heal properly it is a day surgery and you will be able to go home the same day and then i'm going to have you follow up with me here in the clinic you'll be in a cast and you will need to use crutches and you will not be able to use that left foot for about six to eight weeks now after that six to eight weeks you will gradually start walking on your foot based on how you tolerate it and we'll see how you do at that point so i do believe you're gon na need surgery i i'm recommending this because there are significant complications to your foot if we do not do this poor bone and ligament healing can lead to losing the arch of your foot and you're becoming flat-footed you also have a high likelihood of developing arthritis in that foot so what i'm gon na do unfortunately you'll be out the rest of the season but we are gon na get you fixed up and ready for next season if you're okay with all of this i'm gon na have the nurse come in and get you started on your paperwork and then i will see you on monday morning and we will get your foot taken care of

MEDICAL NOTE:

CHIEF COMPLAINT

Bilateral elbow pain, right worse than left.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Dylan Bennett is a pleasant 53-year-old male who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of bilateral elbow pain, right worse than left.

The patient has been experiencing bilateral elbow pain, right worse than left, for approximately 1.5 years. His pain is localized to the medial aspect of his elbows and is described as being extremely sore, worse with increased use of his upper extremities. Of note, he utilizes heavy weights for strength training and was very active in sports when he was younger, primarily playing basketball, baseball, and football, but he denies having any pain at that time. Applying ice to the area has not been helpful, but he does use ibuprofen 800 mg 3 times daily.

SOCIAL HISTORY

The patient reports that utilizes heavy weights for strength training. He was also very active in sports when he was younger, primarily playing basketball, baseball, and football.

He is expecting a newborn baby in the near future.

MEDICATIONS

The patient reports that he has been taking ibuprofen 800 mg 3 times daily.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Musculoskeletal: Reports bilateral elbow pain, right worse than left.

PHYSICAL EXAM

CV: Pulses are equal in all extremities.
NEURO: Sensation is normal to light touch distally.
MSK: 
Examination of the right elbow: Limited range of motion with extension with pain. Full range of motion with flexion with pain. Pain to palpation along the medial aspect. No pain to palpation on the lateral aspect of the elbow. Pain with supination. No pain with pronation.
Examination of the left elbow: minimal pain with flexion and extension Slight Limited ROM on extension of the arm. Pain with supination. No pain with pronation.

RESULTS

X-ray images of the bilateral elbows were obtained and review in office today. These reveal no evidence of fracture or bony misalignment.

ASSESSMENT

Bilateral medial epicondylitis.

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, we had a lengthy discussion in regards to his current symptoms. I want to get an MRI of the bilateral elbows for further evaluation. We discussed the possibility of performing a whole blood transfusion to encourage healing, and the patient is already familiar with this procedure.

---------------------------------------------","[doctor] hey dylan what's going on so i lift quite a bit of weights i try to stay in shape as much as i can i'm not like normal people i lift heavy weights and my elbow is extremely sore which elbow is it

[patient] yes
[doctor] how about this
[patient] yes

[patient] yes
[doctor] okay so pain on the medial side with palpation
[patient] yes
[doctor] alright how about the outside

[doctor] pain with supination no pain with pronation
[patient] correct
[doctor] alright so dylan it took some x-rays coming in looks like you do n't have any any fractures or any bony misalignment which i expect with this kind of injury i do think that what you have is medial epicondylitis which is
[patient] is that golfer's elbow
[doctor] yes same thing have you been golfing a lot
[patient] well not in the past year and a half i've had this for a long time
[doctor] okay also known as pictures elbow
[patient] well i have n't been pitching either

[patient] mm-hmm
[doctor] that will be our next step so we'll get you scheduled for the mri probably get you in pretty quick here since we're a private practice
[patient] thank god
[doctor] yeah and once you get the mri i'll know a little bit more what i'd like to do is something called a whole blood transfusion have you heard of that before
[patient] no please tell me remind me
[doctor] yeah it should help with the healing of your elbow it's just a procedure we'll stick a needle in your elbow
[patient] you do a stick needle in my elbow
[doctor] mm-hmm and help with some of the healing of your elbow
[patient] so it's kinda like dry needling then
[doctor] no
[patient] not at all
[doctor] what is it
[patient] is it is that that thing where like you take the blood out of like say my my thigh
[doctor] mm-hmm
[patient] and then you literally inject it into my tendon
[doctor] yes
[patient] that it activates the healing
[doctor] yeah that's exactly what it is
[patient] interesting cool
[doctor] yeah
[patient] maybe i have heard about that
[doctor] we've we've had some really good responses from other patients on it so hopefully i mean that should be a good solution for you since you've been having issues with this
[patient] i'm excited
[doctor] yeah and we can hopefully get you scheduled for that in the next couple of weeks it's not not a major procedure and you should heal in the next two weeks so that wo n't be a problem especially considering that you're expecting a newborn soon we want to make sure you're all healed for that
[patient] wow i did n't even say that
[doctor] i read it in your chart

RESULTS

Echocardiogram reveals a preserved ejection fraction of 55%, abnormal diastolic filling, and mild-to-moderate mitral regurgitation.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

1. Congestive heart failure.
- Medical Reasoning: This appears to have been caused by dietary indiscretion and uncontrolled hypertension.
- Patient Education and Counseling: I encouraged the patient to continue making dietary modifications, including limiting her sodium intake. She could try keeping a food diary, as previously discussed, to log her diet and associated blood pressure readings. I also advised her to monitor her weight daily and contact me if she gains 3 pounds in 2 days.
- Medical Treatment: Continue with Bumex 2 mg once daily. Referral placed for consult with a nutritionist for education and recommendations regarding her diet.

2. Hypertension.
- Medical Reasoning: This has been poorly controlled due to inconsistent compliance with medication and dietary indiscretion.
- Patient Education and Counseling: We discussed dietary modifications as noted above.
- Medical Treatment: She can continue on Cozaar 100 mg daily and Norvasc 5 mg once daily. Renal artery ultrasound ordered to rule out any issues such as renal artery stenosis.

MEDICAL NOTE:

CHIEF COMPLAINT

Follow-up bilateral breast cysts.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Donna Torres is a 40-year-old female who presents for follow-up surveillance of bilateral breast cysts.

The patient reports continual presence of “lumps” in bilateral breasts with some soreness. She is being seen today for surveillance of the cysts. The patient is taking progesterone, which was initially prescribed to support normalization of menstruation, which was effective. She is also still using vaginal cream one time per week which has improved symptoms of itching and discomfort.

Her last pap smear was in 2019, with negative/negative results. She did have an abnormal pap smear in 2009, which resulted in repeat pap smears per 6 months until her results normalized.

Mrs. Torres experienced increased anxiety in 11/2021 and 12/2021, stating “it was brutal” and felt she could not manage her symptoms and sought treatment. Dr. Brown started the patient on Buspar, which has successfully controlled her anxiety. The patient relates her anxiety to work related stress and possibly aging. Her work involves supporting Covid evaluation centers and clinics. She confirms receiving both Covid vaccinations. Initially, she was experiencing spikes in anxiety prior to menstruation, but her anxiety then became more random with an unclear cause. To note, the patient was started on Singulair, which the patient was told could also cause anxiety.

The patient discontinued Camila birth control, which did result in a significant increase in appetite. This has resolved and she reports she has lost weight in the past 6 months.

[doctor] hi donna ! how are you ?
[patient] i'm good . how about you ?
[doctor] i'm doing well , thank you . and so , i saw that dr. brown put you on buspar . have you been on that before ?
[patient] no , that's new .
[doctor] okay . how is it working for you ?
[patient] my anxiety is going good now , thankfully . i'm serious , it was brutal in november and december . finally , i was like , "" i can not do this . "" i have no idea why it happened . dr. ward did put me on singulair , and she did say we need to be careful because singulair can cause anxiety . so i'm not sure if that was the issue or what .
[doctor] mm . okay .
[patient] and it would , um , start usually during the day , at work .
[doctor] i see .
[patient] i mean , i'm fine now .
[doctor] well , that's good , that things have settled . i do wonder if some of what you are dealing with is hormonal , and that's why i was asking . 'cause you were on the progesterone , and i feel like you were having some irritability back then too .
[patient] i did .
[doctor] and that was before we started the progesterone .
[patient] yes .
[doctor] so i know we started it for regulating your periods , but perhaps it helped with this also .
[patient] yeah . and before , in november and december , i noticed that the week before my period , my anxiety would go through the roof . which then , i knew my period was coming . then it turned into my anxiety spiking just at random times .
[doctor] hmm , okay .
[patient] and it seemed like it was for no reason .
[doctor] but november and december you were on the progesterone at that time .
[patient] yes .
[doctor] all right . so not really a link there , all right .
[patient] yeah , i do n't know .
[doctor] yeah , i do n't know either . um , sometimes with the aging process , that can happen too .
[patient] i figured maybe that's what it was .
[doctor] and we did go through the golive in november and december , so that can be pretty stressful also .
[patient] yeah , and at work , that's when i first started to lead the process of delivering the results to patients with covid . in the beginning of the whole pandemic , patients would have to wait nine days before they'd get their results . and then we opened the evaluation centers and the covid clinic . so i think it just took a toll on me .
[doctor] yeah , i can absolutely see that .
[patient] yeah , and then i was feeling selfish because i was n't even on the front lines . i mean , i was supporting people , sure , but i was n't in the icu . so i felt selfish and guilty . i mean , hands down , the physicians and nurses were in the thick of it and there i was , having anxiety . and it felt ridiculous .
[doctor] well , honestly , you feel how you feel and what you were doing was n't easy as well , so ... but let's see . i need to just put this dax back to work . all right , so no other issues whatsoever ?
[patient] no .
[doctor] have you lost weight ?
[patient] no , but i stopped taking the camila birth control . my hunger level was at a new high . i mean , i was eating constantly . i felt like , "" what is going on ? ""
[doctor] all right .
[patient] and now i am feeling better .
[doctor] okay , that's good . and your masked face , though , it does look thinner .
[patient] well , the past six months i have lost some weight .
[doctor] okay , good . um , anything else going on ?
[patient] no .
[doctor] all right . so your pap was in 2019 . i do n't think that we need to repeat that because it was negative/negative . um , have you ever had an abnormal pap ?
[patient] not with you , but i did around 2009 , and then i had to be seen every six months for a while . and then i had a normal pap .
[doctor] all right , well , let's just repeat it then .
[patient] yeah , that's fine with me , to be safe .
[doctor] okay . i know it sounds superstitious , but i feel like with all the immunocompromising , the pressure , the stress that people's bodies have been under , and the potential for getting covid or the vaccine ... i have actually seen some , um , an increase in abnormal paps in people who have been fine for a while . so that's why i figure let's just check .
[patient] okay . i fight the vaccine fight every day at home because my husband is n't ready to get it . same with my daughter . she shares the same worries as her dad in how it'll impact her when she gets older .
[doctor] have you had the vaccine ?
[patient] yes , i have . and so has my son . he , um , has had his first already .
[doctor] okay . well , you know , you can only do what you can do .
[patient] yeah , i agree .
[doctor] all right . well , let's complete your exam .
[patient] all right .
[doctor] so let's take a deep breath . and again . all right , you can breathe normally . all right , and take one more deep breath . okay , now i'm gon na touch your neck . go ahead and swallow . perfect . and just place your hand above your head . okay , i do feel some little bumps .
[patient] yeah , but they're not as big as they were .
[doctor] mm-hmm . okay , in this breast it does feel a little bit denser . does it hurt at all ?
[patient] it does , where your left hand just was .
[doctor] okay , right here ?
[patient] yeah , down here . but whenever i breastfed , it was always sore there too . i had a clog and something else . the lumps do feel smaller , but they are still there , unfortunately .
[doctor] yeah , they are . uh , well now i do n't know , because if it was the progesterone , they would've gone away .
[patient] yeah .
[doctor] all right , well just let your knees just op- relax and open . how's the itching or discomfort ? are you still using the cream ?
[patient] yes , and i actually need to get that refilled for the first time ever .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] uh , but yeah , i use it once a week and it does help .
[doctor] okay , great . all right , looks good .
[patient] good .
[doctor] you can go ahead and sit up .
[patient] thank you .
[doctor] all right , so typically the lumps would often just shrink up pretty quickly after you've had one or two cycles , and you've had two cycles so far . so i think let's just keep monitoring them for now .
[patient] okay . and what could that mean ?
[doctor] well , so just like people have an increased risk of breast cancer , there's also an increased risk for breast issues . you know what i mean ? so for example , cysts and lumps and fibroadenomas , those are all benign things . they're annoying and require some workup , but they're all benign .
[patient] and i'm- i'm just worried because i'm almost 40 and my mom was almost 45 when she was diagnosed with breast cancer . so i mean , i know there's nothing i can do about it , but it's just i feel like , uh , we had it under control and now it is n't .
[doctor] well , i would n't say that . i mean , i feel like we're at a point where we have a good cadence for you having surveillance on things , and i think you are more aware of your breasts than ever before , and things actually have n't changed .
[patient] yeah .
[doctor] so those are all good things .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] because , um , if it was cancer , we'd actually , we would see some change .
[patient] we would ? okay , thank you for explaining that .
[doctor] yeah . so i know it's annoying and distressing , but i think that's where we're at . it's annoying that you have the breast issue , and it's annoying that we have to follow them .
[patient] yeah , i agree there .
[doctor] um , but the only extra that i could po- , uh , potentially do , is we could get a breast specialist on the team and have you start to follow with them . and one of the advantages there is that they sometimes will do an ultrasound as an extension of their physical exam , in the office , to check out it- check it out on their own . uh , they also have a lot more experience and more willingness to sometimes perform procedures earlier , if they think it needs , um , if they think it needs to be done . and i think they tend to be much quicker than , you know , like radiology as to biopsy it .
[patient] okay . i'll do whatever you think i should .
[doctor] all right . well , i think since you're feeling worried , let's go ahead and we can get them on board . i'll send out a referral and they will call you within the next couple of business days to schedule .
[patient] okay , i think that sounds great .
[doctor] all right . i do too . all right , well any questions or anything else we can discuss today ?
[patient] no , i think i'm all set .
[doctor] all right , good . all right , well have a good rest of your day and just give us a call if you need anything else .
[patient] all right , thank you . you have a good day too .

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

1. Asthma.
- Medical Reasoning: The patient has experienced an increased need to use her albuterol inhaler. She is not currently utilizing a daily medication. At this time, we will try a daily medication since it looks like she might be having some allergies.
- Patient Education and Counseling: I explained the side effects of albuterol to the patient. We also discussed Singulair and that she should start to see a difference in her breathing within approximately 1 month.
- Medical Treatment: We will start her on a daily asthma medication. She can continue to use the albuterol inhaler. We will start her on Singulair in about a month.

2. Mood.
- Medical Reasoning: The patient reports being under a lot of stress with school. I believe this may be attributing to her mood.
- Medical Treatment: I would like for the patient to be seen by a therapist. She will also complete our screening questionnaire.

Patient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.

INSTRUCTIONS

The patient will follow up in 6 weeks for recheck.

---------------------------------------------","[doctor] okay
[patient] good morning
[doctor] good morning thanks doctor doctor cooper i'm i'm you know i'm a little i'm sad to be in here but you know thanks for taking me in i appreciate it
[patient] sure absolutely what can i help you with today
[doctor] so you know i've been dealing with my asthma and like i tried to join sports but it's really kind of it's getting hard you know and i i i just wonder if there's something that can be done because i really do like playing water polo
[patient] but i'm having difficulty breathing sometimes i've had to like you know stop matches and sit on the side just to kind of like catch my breath and use my inhaler so i was wondering if there was something we could do about it
[doctor] and then like i'm kind of a little bit worried i think my mood is getting a little a little worrisome and i i wanted to explore like what my options were
[patient] okay let's talk about the asthma first so what inhaler are you using now
[doctor] i have an albuterol inhaler
[patient] okay and when when you're having trouble it's usually just around sports that is it keeping you up at night
[doctor] so i do n't really like wake up at night a lot typically like it's sports like you know if i'm doing anything like crazy aerobic or like running or anything i do notice that if any if i'm around smoke i do start coughing a little bit but most of the time it's sports
[patient] okay and can you describe a little bit for me what happens
[doctor] i start to yeah no so i start to feel like there is like some phlegm building up in my in my throat and i start coughing like my chest gets tight i start wheezing and i just have to sit down or else i'm gon na get like lightheaded too
[patient] okay and then when you use your inhaler
[doctor] mm-hmm
[patient] does it does it alleviate the problem
[doctor] so yeah it helps with that like phlegm feeling you know but i still i still have to sit down you know and like breathe and then the thing that i hate about that inhaler is i start getting like shaky is that supposed to be happening
[patient] yes that is unfortunately normal and a side effect with the inhaler
[doctor] okay
[patient] so you use you're using two puffs of the inhaler
[doctor] mm-hmm
[patient] for the symptoms
[doctor] yes
[patient] and then you sit down and does it does it get better within about fifteen minutes or so
[doctor] yeah yeah it does but you know i had to like step out of the the pool to make that happen i'm hoping that there is something else we can do okay have you ever taken any daily medications for your asthma an inhaler or singulair or anything like that no i i just use my inhaler whenever i have an attack
[patient] okay so that's something we might wan na consider but how often is it happening
[doctor] pretty much every time i do any kind of aerobic workout
[patient] okay and outside of physical activity you're not having any problems
[doctor] yeah there's that part where like if i'm around somebody who has been smoking a lot or is currently smoking but i usually just step away i do n't even like to be around them you know that makes sense
[patient] alright well we will look at that tell me about the mood issues you are having
[doctor] yeah so one of the reasons i got into like trying to get into sports is like i feel like you know you you feel a lot more energized and a lot you know happier but like lately i've just been kinda stressed out you know like i have i have like sats that i need to study for i've got like all these ap classes you know there's just it i feel like there's a lot of pressure and you know like i get it but there are times where i'm just like really down and i i do n't really know what else i can do
[patient] okay that makes sense any any difficulty with focusing or you're having difficulty retaining information or is it more feeling sad not having motivation
[doctor] so i think it's like a lot of sadness a lot of like you know i do n't really i kinda feel like you know i do n't really like want to do anything you know my friends will go out and i'll just be like i'd rather be at home i am really tired a lot too
[patient] okay alright well let me let me go ahead and check you out
[doctor] mm-hmm
[patient] and then we can talk a little bit more
[doctor] okay
[patient] i'm gon na take a listen to your heart and lungs
[doctor] mm-hmm
[patient] and everything sounds good
[doctor] let me take a look at your eyes
[patient] mm-hmm and in your ears everything looks okay have you had any problems with allergies you have seasonal allergies or anything like that
[doctor] yeah i think so yeah
[patient] i do see just a little bit of fluid in the ears
[doctor] mm-hmm
[patient] and i'm gon na look in your mouth too
[doctor] okay
[patient] and throat looks fine no tonsils
[doctor] mm-hmm
[patient] lem me go ahead and have you lay back on the table and i'll take a listen to your stomach
[doctor] okay
[patient] everything sounds okay i'm gon na feel around just to make sure everything feels normal
[doctor] mm-hmm
[patient] everything feels fine and i'm gon na check reflexes and they're all normal
[doctor] awesome
[patient] it's really hard to do with actual patient so in terms of the asthma i think we could try a daily medication since it looks like you might be having a little bit of allergies maybe we can try some singulair
[doctor] mm-hmm
[patient] and start with that once you are on that daily and you can continue to use the albuterol inhaler those side effects unfortunately you're right it's it's just one of the expected side effects with an albuterol inhaler i would recommend just what you're doing just sit down for a little bit after you take it
[doctor] and we will get you started on the singulair probably within about a month you should see a difference so i will have you come back in about six weeks and follow up and see how you're doing with that
[patient] in terms of the mood is this new for you
[doctor] yeah i think so like when i started this year
[patient] and it sounds like related to school expectations and the stress with saps and all of that
[doctor] yeah
[patient] okay let's consider having you start seeing a therapist i think that would be a good place to start
[doctor] mm-hmm
[patient] and we will do some screening questionnaires and and then follow up in a couple weeks on that too
[doctor] okay alright sounds like a plan okay

[doctor] hmmm okay understood alright well listen let's go ahead and examine you okay so so on your physical exam your physical exam is pretty normal unremarkable for the most part and you know few things a few exceptions so first of all on your heent exam your eye exam your extraocular motions are intact without pain you have a funduscopic exam that shows no papilledema that's good that just means there's no swelling in the back of your eye and on your neck exam you do have some posterior mild posterior paraspinal muscular tenderness in the cervical spine and in bilateral trapezius musculature as well and some tightness in those muscles as well and otherwise on your exam let's see your heart exam on your heart exam you have that grade three out of six systolic ejection murmur that's unchanged from your prior exam so it just means i hear some sounds in your heart as it's beating and i'm not too worried about that we'll watch that and otherwise normal heart exam and and your physical examination otherwise is normal and unremarkable and so now let's talk about my assessment and your plan so carolyn for your first problem of the headache i do think that you have a tension type headache and i think this because you've got some tension and tightness in your paraspinal muscles meaning the muscles around your neck and your shoulders and you know working at the computer i think is contributing to this and also probably the stress so you can continue to take that tylenol for the pain i'm also gon na give you a mild muscle relaxant i'll write you for flexeril five milligrams three times a day and you can take that that will help relax those muscles in your neck and that should help with the symptoms i want you to come back or give us a call if the headaches become more severe or suddenly worsen or you develop a fever but i do n't think that this is a a sign of a stroke or any bleeding in your brain or anything like that i think it's more related to tightness in your muscles in your neck now for your second problem of your diabetes mellitus let's continue you on the metformin five hundred milligrams i am going to order a hemoglobin a1c and also a cbc and a chem-12 to check some of your blood tests blood chemistries and so forth and we will continue you on the metformin i do want you to check your blood sugars daily and that will be very helpful so when you come back in a month i want you to bring those numbers with you we can talk about it again and please do try to get back into your exercise routine that's really gon na help you keep those blood sugars under control as well okay so how does that sound for a plan any other questions for me
[patient] well would it so only call if if it gets worse or not any better
[doctor] yeah that that just right but also let's set up an appointment in four weeks and i wan na see you back in four weeks if it's not if the headache is not better within the next few days with this flexeril then you can give us a call and and get back in later this week or early next but definitely if things get worse give us a call sooner and you know i meant to ask you on i wanted to ask if you had a history of any any trauma meaning have you hit your head or you have n't fallen hit your head or anything like that have you
[patient] no no i think it's just stress
[doctor] okay alright understood okay great well then i'll see you back in a month if not before okay you take care of yourself nice seeing you

[patient] i've had ibuprofen it it helped some
[doctor] okay got it alright well i'll i'll examine you in a second but before we do that let's talk about some of the other conditions that we're kinda following you for i'm looking at your problem list now and you've got a history of diabetes and you're on metformin five hundred milligram twice a day and your how are you doing with your blood sugars and your and your diet and exercise
[patient] yeah i i check my sugar two or three times a week most of the time it's in that one twenty to one forty range
[doctor] okay
[patient] yeah i take my medicine okay my diet is alright you know i could be fifteen pounds lighter that would be alright but
[doctor] sure
[patient] i i i think the sugar has been okay
[doctor] okay we checked your hemoglobin a1c last time i'm looking at your records in epic and it showed that it was you know seven . one so it's it's it's good but it could be better any you know we talked about it controlling your diet or improving your diet and trying to have a balanced meal and not eating some of these sweets and high sugar items how is that going i know you had talked about your wife being a great cook and making cookies and that's hard to stay away from obviously how are things going with that
[patient] yeah she still makes cookies and i still eat them but you know we are trying to trying to do better trying to stay away from more of those carbs and focus on you know less carby less sweet stuff
[doctor] okay alright yeah that's always a struggle i certainly understand but you know really important with your diabetes just to prevent some of the complications like kidney failure and eye problems and just keep your sugar under balance so i'll order another hemoglobin a1c today we'll check that again today and and you know just reemphasizing the controlling your diet and exercise is super important and then we'll have those results back we'll we'll see if we need to make any modifications okay
[patient] okay
[doctor] for your high blood pressure your blood pressure in the clinic looks pretty good it's about one twenty over seventy right now we have you on norvasc five milligrams once a day how are things going with that are you are you checking that periodically or any issues with that at all
[patient] yeah i guess i check it maybe once a week or two or three times a month and it it the vast majority of the time when i check it it's good usually either that one twenty to one thirty over seventy to eighty range i i think the blood pressure's okay
[doctor] okay
[patient] i have n't had any real problems there i i have had some some swelling in my ankles though
[doctor] okay is that new or is that been going on for a while
[patient] well it it started maybe i do n't know a month or two after i started the norvasc
[doctor] okay
[patient] and i was just wondering if the two might be related
[doctor] yeah i mean certainly it could be it is you know sometimes that medication can cause that so i'll i'll examine you in a second and see if we need to make any modifications okay
[patient] okay
[doctor] alright so and your anything else bothering you today
[patient] no i'm we're doing okay i think
[doctor] so let me examine you for a second i'm gon na go ahead and gabriel i'm gon na do my magic exam now let's pretend i i'm just gon na verbalize some of my findings as i do my exam and so
[patient] these are like my video visit exams
[doctor] exactly so your neck exam has no jvd there is no bruits that i can hear your lung exam no rales no wheezing on your heart exam you do have a two over six systolic ejection murmur you had that in the past so i'm not too worried about that otherwise regular rate and rhythm on your heart exam on your on your on your belly exam is nice and soft on your back exam you do have some tenderness on the left paraspinal area right where i'm pressing right there your straight leg raise test is negative your reflexes are normal you have some just some tenderness in the lower back in the paraspinal area of your back when i palpate there otherwise your neurological exam is normal on your extremity exam you do have this one plus nonpitting edema of your lower extremities which is a little bit of swelling in your ankles no calf tenderness negative homans sign no signs of blood clot that's what that means so let me just review what you know explain what all this means so the back pain the first problem that you're here today for i think this is more of a muscular sprain i'm gon na recommend we start you on some anti-inflammatory naprosyn five hundred five hundred milligrams twice a day and flexeril ten milligrams twice a day as well i'm gon na refer you to for for physical therapy to help strengthen some of the muscles in your lower back i do n't think you need an x-ray at this stage why do n't we start with physical therapy and the muscle relaxers and the pain medicines if it does n't get better then we can get an x-ray but right now i would start with that if that's okay with you any questions about that
[patient] no
[doctor] okay for the diabetes the the second problem that we talked about today i'm gon na order another hemoglobin a1c continue the metformin five hundred milligrams twice a day why do n't we have you come back in about two weeks and we should have some of the results back and we can discuss if we need to make any modifications for that but right now we will continue the course and we will go from there okay for the high blood pressure you do have this one plus edema in your legs i'm gon na go ahead and order some blood work today i'm gon na go ahead and stop the norvasc and we'll put you on some hydrochlorothiazide ten milligrams once a day and if that does n't get if the swelling does n't go away i'm gon na do some more testing for right now let's get some sort off with some cbc and a bmp i'm gon na check your kidney function i'm gon na get another ekg and also i'm gon na get a chest x-ray and we'll go from there but hopefully this will go away once we stop this medication since it started around that time okay okay and i think that's it anything else we forgot about do you need refills for anything

Patient Name: christine hernandez
Age: 39.0
Gender: female 
Chief Complaint: hypothyroidism 
Secondary Complaints: weight loss; acne

---------------------------------------------
MEDICAL NOTE:

CHIEF COMPLAINT

Hypothyroidism.
Abnormal liver enzymes.
Abnormal weight gain.
Acne vulgaris.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Christine Hernandez is a 39-year-old female who presents today for evaluation and management of abnormal liver enzymes and hypothyroidism.

When the patient was last seen, her thyroid medicine was changed to Unithroid, but due to the cost of $75, she has not yet started the new medicine and continues taking her previous thyroid medicine. She denies utilizing the coupon that was previously recommended for the Unithroid. Similarly, the patient was prescribed Epiduo for her acne vulgaris, which she did not fill due to the cost of $100. She tried filling both prescriptions at Walmart.

Mrs. Hernandez still presents with abnormal weight gain. She questioned if her oral contraceptive Microgestin, which was discontinued, could have been the cause. Additional symptoms included acne, hirsutism. She is attempting to modify her intake and plans to resume her gym membership in July as she will be on vacation. She inquired about the impact on weight loss of chromium, CLA, and amino acids.

The patient confirmed that she is taking her high dose Vitamin D as prescribed. She does suffer from constipation and she treats with MiraLAX.

She denies previous treatment for her acne vulgaris. She denies ever using clindamycin topical antibiotic. She reports having sensitive skin, developing rashes with various skin products.

PAST HISTORY

Medical
Hypothyroidism.
Acne Vulgaris.
Vitamin D deficiency.
Abnormal weight gain.
Hirsutism.
Constipation.

CURRENT MEDICATIONS

Benzoyl Peroxide.
Clindamycin Gel applied topically.
Vitamin D 2000 IU daily.
Unithroid.
MiraLAX.

ALLERGIES

No known allergies.

RESULTS

Dexamethasone Suppression Test: Normal.

Salivary Cortisol Tests: 2 out of 3 were normal. Not consistent with Cushing’s Syndrome.

Hepatic Function Panel: ALT 128.
Lipid Panel: Total cholesterol 222 mg/dL, HDL 44 mg/dL, LDL 153 mg/dL, non-HDL 178 mg/dL.

FAI: Normal.

ASSESSMENT

• Hypothyroidism.
• Abnormal liver enzymes.
• Abnormal weight gain.
• Acne vulgaris
• Vitamin D deficiency.
• Hirsutism

PLAN

Hypothyroidism
The patient will again attempt to initiate Unithroid. I have printed out the prescription and a discount card, which should result in a reduced price. She will contact my office if she encounters additional issues.

Abnormal liver enzymes
We have seen improvement since the discontinuation of Microgestin. I recommended the spermicide Phexxi for alternative birth control. The patient will also continue working on weight loss, which should additionally improve her liver enzymes.

Abnormal weight gain
Cushing’s Syndrome has been ruled out. I reviewed the weight loss study with the patient, she will call within a month if she is interested in participating. I advised her to follow a low carbohydrate, low cholesterol, abstain from alcohol, and reduce fatty foods diet.

Acne vulgaris
Epiduo was not covered and too expensive. The patient will try benzoyl peroxide and Clindamycin separately to see if the price improves.

Vitamin D deficiency
The patient will complete the high dose vitamin D and then should start vitamin D 2000 IU per day to maintain her levels.

Hirsutism
Her androgen levels were normal.

INSTRUCTIONS

She will repeat all labs prior to her next visit.","[doctor] next patient is christine hernandez , uh , date of birth is january 13th , 1982 .
[doctor] hey , miss christine , how are you doing today ?
[patient] i'm good , thanks . how are you ?
[doctor] i'm pretty good . so it looks like you've completed the covid vaccine , that's great .
[patient] yes , i did .
[doctor] anything new since your last visit ?
[patient] no , i did all the tests that you had recommended me to take . i have n't been able to take the thyroid medicine , the one that you prescribed , as i'm still taking my old one . um , the price was a little high on the new one .
[doctor] okay , so did ... did you try the coupon that i gave you ?
[patient] i did not try the coupon , uh , there was a charge of $ 75 .
[doctor] okay , well , next time that ... that coupon should help , and it should only be about $ 3 .
[patient] okay , um ... i do n't have it , do you happen to have another one you can give me ?
[doctor] yep , right here .
[patient] wonderful , thank you so much , and ... and then the gel , they are charging me $ 100 for it . so , i do n't know if this is because it's a ... it's wal-mart , or if i should try somewhere else , or ... maybe you know how or where i can get it cheaper .
[doctor] yeah , let's try something else , um ... sometimes it can be cheaper if we just prescribe you the individual ingredients of a medication , rather than the , the combined medication itself .
[patient] that would be great .
[doctor] so , that's clindamycin gel and benzoyl peroxide , uh , maybe by doing them separately , they could be a lot cheaper . so , that we can do . the unithroid , with the discount code , should only be about $ 9 for 90 days .
[patient] okay , that would be great . yeah , they were charging me $ 75 , and i just could n't pay that .
[doctor] maybe we'll try different pharmacy , as well .
[patient] okay . so , do you think that my weight gain could have been the birth control that i was taking before that caused it ?
[doctor] maybe . i do n't really see an endocrine cause for it , at least , so i would need to see the , the hyperandrogynism or high testosterone . or , a high dhea , to cause acne , or hair growth , or any of that stuff . but , the numbers are n't showing up out of range .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] i really do n't see any endocrine cause for it , like i said . your growth hormone was fine , but we definitely want to and need to treat it . um , i do n't know if we talked about maybe a little weight loss study .
[patient] you mentioned the weight loss study , and you mentioned that i have some meal plans , um , that you had given me . i still have those , too .
[doctor] have you tried to make any changes in the diet since the last time we spoke ?
[patient] i've been trying to get better . i will start back at the gym in july , because of my contract , i had to put a hold on it until then .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] so , i do want to start doing that . i will be a little freer since , um , i'll be on vacation after july 8th .
[doctor] okay , good .
[patient] and then my cousin was telling me to ask you about cla , because it's supposed to help your metabolism . is that okay to take ?
[doctor] um , i'm not sure . what is c , cla ?
[patient] i'm not sure what it is , either .
[doctor] okay , well , i'm unfamiliar with it , so ...
[patient] okay . i also have a coworker who has a thyroid issue too , and she suggested to try chromium for weight loss .
[doctor] so , that likely will not help too much . you can try either , if you really want to , but then ... it will not accept you into the weight loss study if you try those two .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] chromium is just a supplement and it wo n't help that much .
[patient] it wo n't , okay , thank you .
[doctor] it wo n't hurt ... okay , i should n't say that it wo n't hurt , but , it also wo n't help that much . so , it's up to you .
[patient] okay . and so , my cousin also suggested amino acids , and that i might find them in certain foods , i guess , for my workout .
[doctor] yeah . amino acids are fine , they wo n't , wo n't really help with weight loss either , but it might help , uh , you replenish , and just kind of , feel hydrated .
[patient] okay . are they proteins ? um , my cousin said she had lost some weight , and has been working out every day , but she does n't work , so ... i do n't know .
[doctor] yes , amino acids are what make up the protein , which is in any food you eat , with any protein . so , meats , dairy , nuts , any of that sort of thing .
[patient] okay , thank you . got it .
[doctor] all right . um , are you allergic to any medications ?
[patient] no , not that i know of .
[doctor] okay . is your s- skin pretty sensitive ?
[patient] yes .
[doctor] all right .
[patient] um , yeah , my size , i will start getting rashes , with different products .
[doctor] and have you ever tried clindamycin topical , as an antibiotic for your acne ?
[patient] no , i've never tried anything for it .
[doctor] okay . we might give you some of that .
[patient] okay . and i also want to mention that my feet do swell up a lot .
[doctor] okay . i'm ... let me take a look at that for just a moment . um , any constipation ?
[patient] yes , i also do have that problem .
[doctor] all right . mira- miralax will definitely help with that .
[patient] okay , yes , my doctor did also recommend that .
[doctor] great . all right , let's do an exam real quick . please have a seat on this table and i'll listen to your lungs and heart .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] all right , deep breath . all right , again .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] all right , sounds good .
[patient] great .
[doctor] let me take a look at your feet and ankles .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] all right , they look okay right now , certainly let your doctor know about this if it gets any worse or reoccurs .
[patient] okay , i will do that .
[doctor] now , let's go over your lab work . so , when you took that pill , the dexamethasone test , you passed , which means you do n't have cushing's syndrome . on that test , at least . the salivary cortisol , though , unless you did one wrong ... two of them were completely normal and one was abnormal , so , we might need to repeat that in the future .
[patient] okay , that's okay .
[doctor] all right , so , your cholesterol was quite high . the total cholesterol was 222 . the good cholesterol was about 44 . the bad was 153 , and it should be less than 100 . the non-hdl was about 178 , and it should be less than 130 . the good cholesterol should be over 50 , and it was 44 . so , your screen for diabetes is ... was fine . you do have a vitamin d deficiency , and , i do n't know if we started the vitamin d yet , or not .
[patient] yes , we did . i- i do need to take one today , though .
[doctor] okay . so , i also checked a lot of other pituitary hormones , iron levels ... everything else seemed to be pretty good , and in decent range .
[patient] okay , that sounds great . so , i wanted to also show you my liver enzymes , um , because i have n't come back since then ... but i was also happy , because one of them was back to normal .
[doctor] okay , great . let's see them .
[patient] okay . so , the one that's 30 , that was almost 200 not so long ago .
[doctor] yeah , your alt was about 128 .
[patient] okay , and , and back in october was 254 .
[doctor] yeah , this is much better .
[patient] okay , great . and then it dropped in january , and then it dropped a little more in march , since i stopped taking the medicine in december .
[doctor] okay , that's good . so ... i'm proud of you with the course of your labs , so before i forget , i'm going to , uh , just put your labs into the computer today , and i wo n't be checking your vitamin d level for some time .
[patient] okay . so , with the thyroid , and the low vitamin d , does that always happen together ?
[doctor] um , i do have a lot of people that have thyroid , thyroid issues and they have vitamin d deficiency .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] this is what i'm , um , i'm going to do . i'm going to put , print out your prescriptions , so you can shop around at the pharmacies and see if you can find better prices .
[patient] okay , that way i can go ask them and try cvs .
[doctor] yeah , that sounds like a plan .
[patient] okay , good . so , the weight loss study that you mentioned , when does that start ? or , how does that work ?
[doctor] so , we are about to start , as we just got approval last week , and we are just waiting on our paperwork so we can get started .
[patient] okay , and what's involved with that ?
[doctor] so , it'll involve you receiving a medication which has been used for diabetes treatment , and it works mostly in the gut on satiety , or satiety hormones . um , the most common side effects are going to be nausea , vomiting , diarrhea and constipation . they are s- uh , six arms , to the study . one is a placebo , the other ones are a , various as ... various dosages of the medication , excuse me . um , you would receive an injection once a week . also , keep in mind that most of the weight loss medications are not covered by insurance .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] so , it's a way of getting them , but , the odds of getting one of the arms with the medication that are in your favor , right , might be only one out of five of our hundred patients that we have on the list for the study that will receive the placebo .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] does that make sense ?
[patient] yes , it does .
[doctor] so , we do expect pretty big weight loss , because of what we learn in diabetes study . so , it's a year long , uh , process , and it's an injection once a week . you come in weekly for the first four , five weeks , i believe . and then , after that , it's once a month . you do get a stipend for partici- for participating in the study , and parking is validated , and whatever else that you need for the study .
[patient] okay , do you know how much the stipend is ?
[doctor] um , i will have to double check for you , and , you do n't have to be my patient , you just have to meet the criteria . so the criteria is a bmi greater than 30 , if you do n't have any other medical condition . or , a bmi greater than 27 , if you do have another medical condition , like your cholesterol . um , a bmi greater than 27 would quali- uh , qualify you .
[patient] i have a friend who might be interested , and she does have diabetes .
[doctor] if she has d- diabetes , then she wo n't qualify .
[patient] okay , you ca n't if you ... if you have diabetes , got it .
[doctor] correct . yeah , the only thing that , um , they can not have , really , is diabetes . so , either a psychiatric disease , or schizophrenia , bipolar , things like that .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] but , if they have hypertension , high cholesterol , things like that ... they can definitely sign up .
[patient] and they can , okay . thank you for explaining that .
[doctor] of course . so , do you want me to try to get you into that study ? or , would you just like to try , me to prescribe something ? it's kind of up to you .
[patient] i think i'll just wait for a little bit now .
[doctor] all right , sounds good . i'll give you the information for the research , it's just in my office . um , it is a different phone number , though . so then , if you're interested , just call us within a month , because i do n't know how long , uh , the , the wait will be .
[patient] okay , will do .
[doctor] perfect . so , let me go grab your discount card for the unithroid . um , when you go in to activate it , the instructions are on this card , and then you use your insurance ... then , show them this , and ask how much it'll cost . if it's too expensive , just let me know .
[patient] i will . thank you so much for your help on that .
[doctor] you're welcome . then , what i did is , i gave you a topical antibiotic , plus i gave you the benzoyl peroxide . so , the peroxide may bleach your sheets , but , you want to make sure to take it and apply it at night , so you do n't have a reaction from the sun during the day .
[patient] okay , i can do that .
[doctor] but , you do also want to make sure that you do n't mess up your sheets .
[patient] okay , sounds good .
[doctor] um , so , that's that . and then , let's see how you do on the other medications . i think this will , this will get better . in the meantime , a low-carb diet , avoid alcohol and fatty foods , and low chole- cholesterol foods .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] and again , once you finish your dose of vitamin d , for the vitamin d deficiency , you're gon na start with the 2000iu daily , so that you're able to maintain those levels . sound good ?
[patient] yes , that sounds great .
[doctor] i really think your liver enzymes are going to get better once you lose the weight , though .
[patient] okay , that would be great .
[doctor] since we stopped your birth control , we can try once called phexxi , which is kind of like a spermicide , basically .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] and you just apply it before intercourse .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] if you need some , uh , just let me know .
[patient] okay , i will . i'll let you know .
[doctor] okay , perfect . so , stay put for me now . i'm going to go see if they have discount samples , and bring you that prescription . and then , i'm going to order the labs for next time .
[patient] okay , great , thank you so much .
[doctor] you're welcome .
[doctor] so , under the plan , under abnormal liver enzymes , they have improved since discontinuation of her birth control . under abnormal weight gain , her dexamethasone suppression test was normal . two out of three salivary cortisol tests were normal , not consistent with cushing's , and therefore we're ruling out cushing's . under her hirsutism , her androgen levels were normal . for the acne vulgaris , the epiduo was not covered , so we'll try benzoyl peroxide with clindamycin , and remove the previous information . on the hyperthyroidism , we'll print out her prescriptions . unithroid should be better priced with the discount card , and we'll repeat levels of everything before next visit . thanks .",3536.217391304348,"Benzoyl Peroxide.

MEDICAL NOTE:

CHIEF COMPLAINT

Hypogonadism.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Mr. Paul Edwards is a 59-year-old male, an established patient, who presents to the clinic today for hypogonadism. He was last seen on 11/24/2020. The patient’s history includes positive for HIV, and today he is concerned with gynecomastia.

The patient is doing well, overall, and feels the testosterone is helping. He reports weight stability, feels lively, good, more vigorous, and he is sleeping well. He also thinks the testosterone is having a positive effect on his blood work. He endorses that his triglycerides have always been elevated and adds that they were as high as 265 mg/dL. The patient presented a copy of his bloodwork, showing a significant decrease in his cholesterol after 5 months. Mr. Edwards questioned if the changes in his blood work were due to the testosterone. He also noted that his red blood cell count has not increased. The patient inquired about possible benefits of Indole-3-carbinol, which is a broccoli extract for estrogen control.

Currently, the patient is dosing 140 ng/dL of testosterone per week and inquired if his dose could be increased to 175 ng/dL. He recalled that he had recently injected testosterone before his last testosterone blood work was performed; last testosterone levels were greater than 1500 ng/dL. The patient confirms continued daily use of Finasteride and Cialis, prescribed by me, and stated he needs a refill for both.

Mr. Edwards mentioned he is taking correct steps to get his life ""together."" He also uses a med calendar to help with medication compliance.

PAST HISTORY

Medical
HIV

SOCIAL HISTORY

Utilizes med calendar to support medication compliance.
Actively trying to get his life together.

CURRENT MEDICATIONS

Cialis 5 mg tablet by mouth on days he exercises, 2.5 mg tablet by mouth on days without exercise.
Finasteride 5 mg half tablet daily.
Testosterone cypionate 140 mg.

RESULTS

PSA 0.6 ng/mL.
Triglycerides 145 mg/dL.
Total testosterone 1500 ng/dL, 11/24/2021.

ASSESSMENT

• Hypogonadism.

PLAN

I recommend maintaining current management. The patient’s last testosterone levels were greater than 1500 ng/dL, although this level was likely related to his recent injection. He requested an increase to his testosterone cypionate from 140 mg to 175 mg, which I denied due to his already high testosterone levels. I counseled the patient on the risks associated with high testosterone levels and Indole-3-carbinol and it’s lacking evidence to support his estrogen levels. The last time his estradiol levels were checked, they were normal; recommend annual screening.

I provided paper prescription refills for Cialis and Finasteride.","[doctor] next patient is paul edwards , date of birth is january 15th 1962 . so he's a 59 year old hiv positive gentleman here for hypogonadism . patient was last seen on november 24th 2020 . his notable things are number one , he is on 1 milliliter every 10 days , uh , his levels were less than 300 to begin with . he's on finasteride currently . he also takes cialis daily so he takes all his pills just from me . um , patient's other area of concern is gynecomastia which is ... which we will discuss with him today . his last psa was 0.66 and his last testosterone was greater than 1,500 .
[doctor] hey , how are you today ?
[patient] all right , how have you been ?
[doctor] i'm good .
[patient] good , good .
[doctor] have you lost some weight or are you at least putting on some muscle ? you look trim .
[patient] no , i think i'm pretty much the same as i've always been .
[doctor] really ? okay , maybe it's just your black shirt . makes you look thin .
[patient] yeah , i guess that's it .
[doctor] so health wise , how is everything going ?
[patient] good , the testosterone's going well .
[doctor] that's great .
[patient] uh , it helped me out . i feel good , more vigorous , sleeping well and i think it's having some positive effects . not so much physically because like i said i've- i've been this way my whole life , but i'm seeing some good improvements in my bloodwork .
[doctor] okay , well that's good .
[patient] so the finasteride i'm only taking half a pill , it's the 5 milligram one .
[doctor] yeah , i remember you telling me that .
[patient] and cialis , on the days i work out i take 5 milligrams otherwise i take two and a half milligram pills , but , uh , i have been out of it .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] but overall i'm doing well , i'm actually taking the correct steps to get my life together .
[doctor] good . it's always great to hear . well let's take a look . uhm , i'm gon na listen to your heart and lungs .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] please use my general exam template , all right . just take a few breaths .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] in and out .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] all right , everything sounds good , no concerns there .
[patient] great . so i wanted to show you something .
[doctor] sure .
[patient] look at this .
[doctor] okay , this is your cholesterol ?
[patient] yeah , my cholesterol and triglycerides . uh , i used to have high triglycerides , you see they were 265 milligrams per deciliter , and i took my first dose of the testosterone on the 28th .
[doctor] right .
[patient] now 5 months later look at my numbers .
[doctor] wow , that's remarkable .
[patient] is it the test ? it's the only change .
[doctor] i do n't know , i have n't honestly seen many guys over the years that have cholesterol problems and this . i mean there's a big correlation between diabetic control and testosterone replacement , meaning those who get good levels of their test see their diabetic control improve .
[patient] yeah .
[doctor] but i have n't seen a lot of data on the impact on cholesterol . regardless , we will take it .
[patient] i agree . i was very impressed with my triglycerides and was just wondering if the test may be what's helping .
[doctor] yeah , that's an unbelievable difference .
[patient] 145 milligrams per deciliter from 265 milligrams per deciliter is awesome . i also read that it- it's cardioprotective .
[doctor] absolutely .
[patient] my red blood cell count has increased .
[doctor] yeah , i saw that . it's fine though .
[patient] stable .
[doctor] your psa today is also , uh , is good also . it's , uh , .6 i think .
[patient] yeah . , is it ?
[doctor] yeah , it was .5 last year and anything under 4 is good .
[patient] nice , that's good news .
[doctor] so it just needs to be checked every year or so .
[patient] so in terms of , uh , estrogen control i've been hearing that indole-3-carbinol , or broccoli extract , supposedly can improve my estrogen levels . have you ever heard of it ?
[doctor] yeah , i've heard of it but i have n't had anybody consistently use it . i mean , your levels are fine and we checked your estra- estradiol and it was not elevated , so .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] i would argue that we could test that in the fall if you want , but we do n't need to do , uh , do any more tests ... any more than test once a year , excuse me .
[patient] okay , what about increasing my testosterone to 175 milligrams ? i'm at 140 now .
[doctor] well , your levels are high .
[patient] are they right now ?
[doctor] well , i mean they were last time .
[patient] yeah but i just- just injected though , or i had right before that was taken .
[doctor] i know . i know you had then , uh , when did you inject this time ?
[patient] i figure i'm on my eighth day today .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] so i'm due to dose on thursday or friday .
[doctor] all right .
[patient] i have a little med calendar and i put checks and ts on it . that helps me .
[doctor] that's a great idea . so look , the biggest issue i've seen , even if your levels today are around 700 , is that your peaks are getting greater than 1,500 , putting you at a higher chance of needing to come off due to blood thickness . and your risk will only astronomically go up the higher the dose that we go on .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] you look well , your levels are good and you're feeling well .
[patient] yeah , i'm feeling good .
[doctor] i'm going to be blunt . unfortunately this happens often where you're feeling good but you want to feel really good . i mean , i get it and this is why people get into problems with this stuff , right ? it's like , back in the day when it was n't prescribed by doctors and people would get it at gyms and stuff and they would take huge doses . and then they would have a heart attack at 50 .
[patient] yeah , they have to be taking a lot .
[doctor] likely they are taking more than testosterone , but still .
[patient] and they are taking stuff for a long time .
[doctor] true . but right now i would not change your dose .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] make sense ?
[patient] it does , i appreciate the discussion .
[doctor] no problem . what pharmacy are you using ? have you changed it or anything ?
[patient] no changes , i use walmart pharmacy . i do need more cialis and finasteride .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] i would prefer the paper prescription .
[doctor] for all of them ?
[patient] sure .
[doctor] all right , will do . i'm gon na get your prescriptions .

MEDICAL NOTE:

CHIEF COMPLAINT

Follow-up.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Nicole Miller is a 71-year-old female who presents for follow-up. The patient was called in for a follow up with me for chronic congestive heart failure with diastolic dysfunction. Her BNP had been 3000 in 03/2021, up to 6000 in 04/2021. She was increasingly dyspneic. We had changed her furosemide to torsemide at 20 mg by mouth daily. The patient is not on a potassium supplement currently. Her lisinopril had also been increased up to 10 mg daily in 03/2021.

I last saw her in 04/2021, and she had reported being interested in having her right knee replaced this summer at East Metropolitan Hospital, so it was recommended that we work to control her cardiovascular status prior to surgery. She is currently scheduled to have surgery on 06/24/2021. She plans to discontinue clopidogrel a week before her surgery.

The patient states that she has lost approximately 3 to 3.5 pounds since her last visit in 04/2021. Some of which may be water weight decreasing. She did report experiencing bilateral leg cramps which she treated with consumption of pickle juice, which did resolve the cramps. She thought the cramps were related to her being cold.

She is still taking iron supplementation. She denies any concerns with defecation.

Regarding her prior symptoms of heartburn, she denies any recent gastrointestinal issues. She notes that her heartburn was severe at one point but resolved after trying Prilosec for 2 weeks in 01/2021. She denies any issues with heartburn since that time and has stopped taking Prilosec altogether. She has since transitioned back to her original ""stomach medication"".

The patient is due for a colonoscopy. She is currently double covered with Medicare and private insurance.

PAST HISTORY

Medical
Chronic Congestive Heart Failure.
Iron deficiency Anemia.

Medications
Prilosec.

FAMILY HISTORY

No family history of colon cancer.

CURRENT MEDICATIONS

Torsemide 20 mg by mouth daily.
Lisinopril 10 mg daily.

RESULTS

Magnesium 1.7, hemoglobin WNL, potassium 3.9, creatinine 0.7, BUN 23.
03/2020 Hgb A1c 5.5.

ASSESSMENT

• Chronic congestive heart failure with mixed presentation.
• Preop examination.
• Diabetes mellitus.
• Colonoscopy

PLAN

Chronic congestive heart failure with mixed presentation.
She had an exacerbation of CHF earlier in the spring. We switched her from furosemide to torsemide and symptomatically, she is doing a lot better. She is about 1.5 kg down in weight. Her breathing is nonlabored. We are going to repeat an EKG today. Otherwise, continue her current regimen. Labs were checked and creatinine is appropriate. Her magnesium is below the preferred 2 at 1.7, with some occurrence of bilateral leg cramping, therefore we will start her on magnesium supplement.

Preop examination.
She is going to be having a right knee replacement at the end of 06/2021. We will schedule a preop check the first week or two of June prior to the surgery. She will discontinue clopidogrel for one week prior to knee replacement surgery; we will provide a reminder to patient of this as well.

Diabetes mellitus.
A1c is 5.5 on last check, so there is no need for a further A1c today. She may need another one prior to her surgery next month.

Colonoscopy.
The patient is overdue for a colonoscopy, which we will try to have done at County Hospital in the next month, prior to a change in her insurance. This is just a screening colonoscopy that she is overdue for. No family history of colon cancer.

The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.

INSTRUCTIONS

Complete EKG today. Schedule a preop checkup 1st or 2nd week of June. Start magnesium supplement. Call the clinic with any questions or new symptoms.","[doctor] next patient is nicole miller . date of birth is 09/18/1949 . patient was called for a follow-up with me for chronic congestive heart failure with diastolic dysfunction . bmp's been , uh , 3,000 in march , and is about six- was up to 6,000 in april . she was increasingly dyspneic . we changed her furosemide and torsemide 20 milligrams by mouth daily . uh to note , the patient is not currently on potassium supplement . her lisinopril had- has also been increased up to 10 milligrams daily in march . also did when i saw her last april . she reported being interested in having her right knee replaced this summer at east metro . it was recommended that we work to control her cardiovascular status before surgery .
[doctor] hey , miss miller , how are you today ?
[patient] i'm doing okay , thank you .
[doctor] i asked you to come in today because we want to keep- we want you to have this knee surgery this summer but we want to keep a close eye on you to make sure a week before your surgery you do n't suddenly go into congestive heart failure and it gets postponed .
[patient] yeah , that would not be good .
[doctor] i see you're scheduled on the 24th for surgery .
[patient] yeah , that's right .
[doctor] okay , good . well it looks like you have lost about 3 , 3 and a half pounds since i saw you last in april . some of that might be water weight , but still , this is positive .
[patient] yeah , i noticed that too . i think the oxyglutinine is helping as well . my urgency to use the bathroom is much better .
[doctor] well that's great .
[patient] yeah , i , i'm pleased about it too .
[doctor] you ever get leg or finger cramps or anything like that ?
[patient] yeah , i had leg cramps the other day , but i thought it might , was maybe just because i was cold as i had my ceiling fan on and fell asleep . i had cramps when i woke up in both legs right here . um i drank pickle juice and it went right away .
[doctor] well do n't , do n't get crazy with the pickle juice because all of the salt in it .
[patient] haha , i know , i only drink about 4 ounces or so .
[doctor] okay good .
[patient] um it went away so i did n't drink anymore . i find it works a lot better than trying to put some cream on my leg .
[doctor] sure just , just keep it in moderation .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] and then are you still on an iron supplement ? and are you using the bathroom okay ?
[patient] uh yes , everything is good .
[doctor] good . how is your heart burn doing ? any problems with that ?
[patient] no , it did get bad for a while so i tried to take some prilosec and then stopped that other one .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] um i did that for like , gosh , i think it was two weeks back in january and have n't had any problems since .
[doctor] great .
[patient] um and after i stopped taking that um i went back to the stomach one , so i'm doing good now .
[doctor] okay and you're still due for a colonoscopy , correct ?
[patient] uh yeah , that's right .
[doctor] all right , let's review your blood work real quick . i checked your hemoglobin level because you have had some anemia in the past but that is still doing great .
[patient] good , that's a relief to hear .
[doctor] your potassium is 3.9 so it's holding steady on the torsemide . your creatinine was .7 not .8 so you're doing well with kidney numbers . your bun may be a tiny bit elevated at 23 which is the number we look for for dehydration sometimes the kidneys , but it's not terrible . um so when i look at your numbers as a whole i think you're tolerating the torsemide okay at the current dose . i also sent out to look at the heart failure number- i sent to look at your heart failure number . there is a test called a bmp that i was monitoring and in march it was up to 3,000 and then went up to 6,000 in april before i made the change . i'm still waiting for those results .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] all in all i think you're doing good on paper though .
[patient] what about , um what's it called , a1c ? does that show up ?
[doctor] um i do n't think i ordered it but i could . your last a1c was 5.5 in march .
[patient] all righty .
[doctor] so your blood sugar is a little bit high , it was 169 today but that kind of depends on what you ate and you were n't fasting for the blood check so i might have to repeat that test for pre-op , but i do n't think we need to do it today .
[patient] all righty that sounds good .
[doctor] i checked your magnesium level because sometimes you uh urinate out magnesium with the water pills but it was normal at 1.7 and your blood pressure is also looking good .
[patient] okay great . that all sounds awesome .
[doctor] all right let's take a quick listen .
[doctor] use my general physical exam template .
[doctor] and take a couple of deep breaths for me .
[doctor] your lungs sound pretty good to me so keep doing what you're doing . um uh , like i said , i think you're doing good overall but let's just talk about a few things .
[patient] all righty .
[doctor] so we often like to keep people with heart problems on magnesium and get their levels up to around the 2-ish range . yours is a little bit less than 2 and we want that 2-ish range because it can help stabilize the heart muscle . so i might recommend putting you on magnesium supplement . it's supposed to be twice a day so that's kind of annoying , but i know you're on other medicines twice a day too , so i think you'll do fine .
[patient] yeah , that'll be okay .
[doctor] great . now before surgery we'll have to get you off your clopidogrel for a week beforehand .
[patient] yes , okay , i have everything written down on my phone , and i have a letter taped to the side of my bed to remind me .
[doctor] perfect ! we will give you a reminder as well . we will also need to complete a pre-op check within two weeks of your surgery during the first or second week of june .
[patient] okay , i'll put that down .
[doctor] you might also have to repeat an ekg before surgery which we could do today . i know i'm sure it feels like you're doing , you're always doing ekgs . um we do n't need to any x-rays of your chest because you had one recently , and we do n't need any more blood work because we did that today .
[patient] yeah , i do a lot of ekgs . i'm basically a regular . but i'm happy to do one today , no problem .
[doctor] lastly , once we get your knee surgery , um we , we should think about getting you a colonoscopy . we can do it here locally because you have medicare . do you have private insurance also ?
[patient] yeah , i have both .
[doctor] okay so yes , you can get it , your colonoscopy , wherever you'd like .
[patient] okay , well my husband's insurance may be running out . might we be able to get the procedure done sooner ? maybe in the next 30 days ? is that okay ?
[doctor] um i can put it in right now for , uh , for county for the next 30 days , and they might be able to get you in within the next few weeks . it should not take , it should not make you ineligible for the surgery . in other words completing a colonoscopy would not delay your surgery .
[patient] okay , good .
[doctor] so let me see . i've been doing one of two things at every one , and everyone is great so it depends more on timing availability of their or for the colonoscopy . we can send you to dr. martin for the surgery who is at county surgical services down here or the other option is valley medical , and they do it at springfield .
[patient] okay , that sounds good .
[doctor] i think either direction they're good technicians of the colon .
[patient] okay , yeah whatever you can get me in , that works great .
[doctor] so i'll call around . now if you get that done and they tell you 10 years then you'll be good to go .
[patient] great , thank you .
[doctor] you're welcome . have a great day . let us know if you need anything else , okay ?
[patient] sounds good .
[doctor] all right , assessment and plan .
[doctor] chronic chf . mixed presentation . had a exacerbation of cf , chf earlier in the spring . we switched her from a furosemide to torsemide and symptomatically she is doing a lot better . she's about 3 , 3 and a half pounds down in weight . breathing is non-labored . going to repeat ekg today but otherwise continue with her current regimen . labs checked and creatinine is appropriate .
[doctor] uh number 2 , pre-op examination . she is , she's having a right knee replacement end of june . also , she would like to have a colonoscopy performed which we'll try to have done at uh bartley regional , rightley regional hospital in the next month , uh , prior to a change in her insurance . this is just a screening colonoscopy that she is overdue for . no family history of colon cancer .
[doctor] uh the next one is diabetes . a1c is 5.1 on the last check so no need for further a1c today . she may need another one prior to her surgery next month though . thanks .",344.6,"Torsemide 20 mg by mouth daily.

Matthew Murphy is a pleasant 20-year-old male who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of left ankle pain. The onset of his pain began 2 days ago, when he stepped off of a curb and landed on his left ankle wrong. He denies hearing a pop at the time of the injury, however, he describes his ankle as feeling extended and stretched. He was able to ambulate back to his house after the incident but with pain. He denies any previous injuries to his left ankle. His pain is localized to the lateral aspect of his left ankle and can be rated at 8 out of 10 without medication. When taking ibuprofen his pain level is 7 out of 10. He states he has also iced and elevated his ankle.

SOCIAL HISTORY

Patient reports that he has been working from home since the start of COVID-19 and enjoys taking lots of walks.

MEDICATIONS

Patient reports taking ibuprofen.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Musculoskeletal: Patient reports left ankle pain.

VITALS

Vitals are slightly elevated due to pain level but are otherwise stable.

PHYSICAL EXAM

NEURO: Normal strength and sensation bilaterally.
MSK: Examination of the left ankle: Ecchymosis noted over the lateral malleolus. Edema is present. Tenderness to palpation laterally. No joint laxity appreciated. No bony tenderness to palpation of the foot. Capillary refill is brisk at less than 3 seconds bilaterally. Strong dorsalis pedis pulses bilaterally.

RESULTS

These reveal no fracture or bony abnormalities.

ASSESSMENT

Left ankle sprain of the lateral ligament complex.

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I have had a lengthy discussion with the patient in regards to his current symptoms. We discussed that his symptoms are consistent with an ankle sprain of the lateral ligament complex. The nature of the diagnosis and treatment options were discussed. At this time he will continue to follow the RICE protocol. He will continue to take NSAIDs as needed for pain and swelling. He will also be placed into an Aircast for ankle stabilization and will be provided crutches in order to remain non-weight-bearing. We discussed that it may be a few days before he feels able to tolerate walking. I also advised him that his symptoms will likely start to improve significantly over the next 4 to 6 days.

INSTRUCTIONS

The patient will follow up with me in 2 weeks to assess his progress, sooner if needed.
